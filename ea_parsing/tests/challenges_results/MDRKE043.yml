  - Delay in the procurement of NFIs attributed to the unintended effects of using cash programming. Because KRCS had been responding to disasters through cash, none of the local providers had readily available stocks for delivery to KRCS. Most of the items were sourced internationally. This resulted in delays during the procurement process that delayed delivery of NFIs in some cases.
