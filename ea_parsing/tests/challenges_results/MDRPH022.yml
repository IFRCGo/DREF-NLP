  sector_title: Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
  items:
  - Many of the barangays/municipalities in the scope of the project have limited water and sanitation infrastructures. Most of the barangays depend on ponds, tube wells and gravity feed systems as their main source of water for drinking, cooking and cleaning.
  - Low visibility of or low priority for water and sanitation awareness in the barangays or at municipalities means there is a significant need for safe water and sanitation infrastructure and promotion. This was particularly the case in Barangay San Vicente with the Dupaningan tribe where PRC was able to support with water and sanitation infrastructure and the software components.
  - Many of the barangays and municipalities are not connected with the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) which prevents a significant amount of water and sanitation related awareness programme and infrastructure development. Communities in the mountainous areas depend on tube wells and gravity feed systems and most of the private companies do not have access to these areas. This is a key area where PRC could play a significant role in supporting the municipal governments in the realization of water and sanitation hardware and software component.
  - "Sanitation coverage in barangays is very low. Not many households have access to improved sanitation facilities, while the rehabilitation of latrines were not included in the SRA package. To address this, PRC rolled-out the software component of sanitation using participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) \u2013 a community-based approach \u2013 and children hygiene and sanitation transformation (CHAST) \u2013 a school-based approach."

  items:
  - 1 For Household Livelihoods now, there was no significant impact in terms of livelihood restoration since most of the beneficiaries are still rearing their livestock options.
  - "2 The livelihood intervention was complemented with a technical training on livestock management in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture through the Municipal Agriculture\u2019s Office. This approach gained appreciation from the beneficiaries because they could receive technical inputs related to their livelihood options."
  - 3 One of the key recommendations during KII and FGD was the provision of business management training for the beneficiaries. This would help them do financial management and better business planning to improve their livelihood options and promote sustainability.
  - "4 For the community-managed project, there was a lack of management capacity. Since this was a newly formed association, most of the members didn\u2019t have knowledge on how to manage an association. This gap was initially identified in the beginning of the project, hence, the association requested support from both PRC and the LGU for capacity building in terms of financial literacy, and training for association management."

  sector_title: Shelter, Housing and Settlements
  items:
  - 1 One of the main challenges for shelter is the huge need versus the financial capacity to respond and support the needs of the community. In Cagayan, a total of 25,388 houses were destroyed and 110,936 were damaged while a total of 10,264 houses were destroyed and 52,496 were damaged in Isabela.
  - 2 Due to lack of funding resources the appeal did not support the construction of core houses but instead concentrated on repairs. Additionally, the SRA package was not always sufficient to fully repair/reconstruct the damaged houses. The SRA package was limited in its dual function to repair the house and also ensure the build back safer principles were applied.
  - 3 There was scarcity of labour force for construction during the implementation of the shelter programme due to the high demand of skilled workers in the area. To mitigate this issue, the operational team formed groups of trained carpenters and masons. These groups were mobilized to do construction works from one community to other.
  - 4 In this operation, skilled workers reported that the wages they received was less compared to the labour work they had provided. The rate should be based on the daily minimum wage in their respective areas. Days of work and the number of carpenters required for a repair should be estimated by a technical person (i.e. engineer and architect).
