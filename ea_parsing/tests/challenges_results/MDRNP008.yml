  - The EPoA target for the construction of DWSS was revised to 35 from 50 through operations update. Initial EPoA target was 50 based on findings from the water source mapping and inventory survey however during the actual construction, per unit costs of some of the big-scale water facilities increased, resulted in excess of approved budget limit. In addition, shortage of trained masons and break in the rate contract also escalated the overall cost of the DWSS construction. With the revision DWSS target, total number of people reach revised to 12,000 from 17, 560 people.
  - Community participation was slow in the initial phase of WASH intervention; especially for the construction DWSS in terms of ownership, labour contribution, maintenance responsibilities. NRCS staff and volunteers conducted door-to-door visits to create awareness, community mobilization and formation of the WUCs.
  - Managing procurement of 200 plus different types of construction material for water schemes (314 DWSS) and toilets (10,000 toilets) to be transported to remote communities of 14 districts through NRCS HQ was challenging and time consuming; especially quantity and type of construction material for each DWSS was possible only upon completing the design. Considering the standard procurement procedure of NRCS that has provision of 40 days tendering process could have significantly delayed delivery of construction materials through parallel tendering process. Hence, ERO took the decision to follow Rate Contract modality with selected vendors for speedy delivery of material in remote communities.

  - The reconstruction of houses slowly started after the disbursement of first instalment of NPR 50,000 per household in August 2016, but could not progress much further as NRA requested partners to wait until it reconfigured the grant distribution amount and tranches which only finalized the guidelines and procedure for the progressive distribution of instalments on 18 January 2017. Further, On 26 September 2016, the Government declared that the funds to be made available to each housing grant beneficiary was to be raised from NPR 200,000 NPR to NPR 300,000, this action led to a review of the IFRC shelter target from a total of 3,000, to 2469 to meet the 50 per cent increase in total shelter cash grants per family. Since January 2017, the distribution of 2nd instalment of NPR 150,000 commenced, and the construction started picking up the momentum. Later, based on MoU signed between beneficiary and the local government this figure further revised to 2,433 families which was announced through operations update.
  - The common challenge experienced during the house construction process in all of the three districts was delayed technical supervision and certification of different stages of construction by the government engineers due to shortage of staff at local levels. Delayed certification of construction phases and approval for releasing next tranche by government engineer to adhere to the national construction standards significantly impacted construction progress.
  - Since the starting of the project, one of the major challenges while implementing ERO had always been lack up local materials such as stone, wood, water and also human resources. Secondly, unavailability of sufficient trained masons at community level and compelled to mobilize the same masons for shelter construction as well as WASH related constructions such as DWSS and toilets. This in turn had resulted in delayed shelter and WASH infrastructure constructions across districts.
  - Finding a suitable space for the construction of community infrastruture was challenging. Hence this activity was deprioritised in three target districts of this appeal. However, IFRC provided support to NRCS and PNSs in assessments, designing, monitoring, quality assurance and contractual agreements for the construction of community infrastructure in other districts where it was feasible.
