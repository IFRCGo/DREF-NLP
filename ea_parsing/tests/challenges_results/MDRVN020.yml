  - Beginning in May 2021, the number of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths began
    to rise dramatically. The overall consultation and assessment process in the communities
    was delayed due to strict transportation restrictions across the country and considerations
    for the safety of staff and volunteers, and it took longer than expected to implement
    the recovery activities.
  - VNRC HQ received several calls from the people assisted in the localities regarding
    the kitchen set support with the message that people preferred cash. The HQ and
    the Red Cross Chapter have worked closely to reallocate the NFIs support to the
    households in needs. Besides, according to the communication among people assisted
    and the local Red Cross Chapter, VND 10 million provided for the repairs work
    was considered inadequate.
  - Three tropical storms named DIANMU, LIONROCK and KOMPASU happened in the last
    quarter of 2021 which delayed the construction and repair process, particularly
    in material transportation and monitoring.

  - Viet Nam government regulations formulated in 2020, around management and use

    agencies, organizations, and individuals for Vietnam; and around the organization
    and management of international conferences and seminars in Vietnam created an
    obstacle for the receipt of the pledge from the American Red Cross for livelihood
    interventions, thus delaying its implementation.
  - It took four months to launch livelihood assistance in the provinces since the
    receipt of the pledge in July 2020. Due to the delay in pledge receipt process,
    the project was extended until the end of 2021 two months later than the initial
    completion date.
  - The change in the leadership of the Vietnam Red Cross since Quarter three of 2021
    led to delays in financial clearance affected the operation of the project directly,
    especially in terms of delaying the transfer of working advance from HQ to local

  - Due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, and the changes
    in the staff of the procurement team at VNRC, the distribution of water tanks
    encountered a wide range of difficulties, especially during the approval and bidding
    process, which delayed the finalization of the procurement. However, by the end
    of October 2021, all the people to be assisted had received their designated water
    tank.
  - COVID-19 prevention measures affected the implementation of activities, which
    restricted the number of people participating in each event. As a result, the
    total number of people reached through the dissemination was less than the initial
    target. Health and hygiene promotion activities were integrated in the same communication/dissemination
    event.
  - Government policies related to the prevention of COVID-19 had a considerable impact
    on the implementation of health promotion activities, which restricted the number
    of people participating in each event to avoid the spread of COVID-19 due to the
    close contact among participants. Besides, the budget used for the communication
    activities is limited, total number of people reached through the dissemination
    was far less than the initial target.

  - Due to the COVID 19 epidemic, which limited movement between provinces, the IFRC
    had to hire three photographers in three of the four project provinces and a field
    producer to capture the achievements of the operation. The photography assignment
    had to be monitored remotely by IFRC staff in Viet Nam as well as from Bangkok
    CCD due to the prevailing travel restrictions thus limiting the guidance to the
    three field photographers in the provinces. This was mitigated to some extent
    by hiring a photographer who had previously covered the disaster during 2020 and
    was familiar with the local context and Red Cross operations, to operate as a
    field producer and guide the field photographers.
  - Lack of disaggregated data has created a wide range of difficulties for the information
    exchange between VNRC and IFRC. In addition to that, photo of the activities undertaken
    in the provinces, which were captured using personal phone of the provincial Chapters,
    did not meet the requirements of the reporting standard.
