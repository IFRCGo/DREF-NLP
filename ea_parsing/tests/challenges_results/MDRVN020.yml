  items:
  - Due to the COVID 19 epidemic, which limited movement between provinces, the IFRC had to hire three photographers in three of the four project provinces and a field producer to capture the achievements of the operation. The photography assignment had to be monitored remotely by IFRC staff in Viet Nam as well as from Bangkok CCD due to the prevailing travel restrictions thus limiting the guidance to the three field photographers in the provinces. This was mitigated to some extent by hiring a photographer who had previously covered the disaster during 2020 and was familiar with the local context and Red Cross operations, to operate as a field producer and guide the field photographers.
  - Lack of disaggregated data has created a wide range of difficulties for the information exchange between VNRC and IFRC. In addition to that, photo of the activities undertaken in the provinces, which were captured using personal phone of the provincial Chapters, did not meet the requirements of the reporting standard.
