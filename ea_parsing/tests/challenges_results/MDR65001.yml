  - Constantly adapting to changing situation and border policies that affected the population on the move with access restrictions, stranded situations and lack of predictability of humanitarian aid to be organized. Even the forecast system would not help as unforeseen situation (ferry strike, sudden closure of borders, etc.) would affect the whole trail.
  - "Standard specification of the humanitarian supplies. People on the move has needs on \u201Clight supplies\u201D as they are on the move fast so the kit needs to be adjusted. People stranded or in camps require different set up or specifications."
  - Mobility of items among countries was not always possible given the earmarking for different contexts.
  - The humanitarian crisis had severe impact and caught authorities, but also humanitarian stakeholders, with limited capacity to address changing needs. Volunteer management was a clear example since many NS did not have enough volunteers or systems in place to enable adequate support in an operation that required constant presence and sudden scale up in times of peaks.
