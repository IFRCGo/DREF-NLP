  - The plan to build shelters at the Guiwa site was delayed due to insecurity, harsh climatic conditions that did not allow mud bricks to dry on time, the unavailability of building materials in the localities, and the brick fabrication site allotted by the local authority that was far from the construction site. However, mud brick fabrication sites were increased in order to accelerate shelter construction. The unfortunate insecurity situation at the Guiwa site delayed construction works during the most appropriate period for shelter construction.
  - The solar lamp provision was scaled down because the solar lamps were of poor quality and transporting them from Nandoungue to Guiwa proved to be difficult. As such, only 100 out of the planned 1000 lamps were distributed in the Guiwa refugee sites.
