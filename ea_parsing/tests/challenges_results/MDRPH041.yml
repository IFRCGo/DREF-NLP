  - 'Geographical Location: SRA was provided on site, where the houses were scattered across the municipalities. Furthermore, the relocation site provided for FSA was far from the initial area of the families and from the chapter, where travelling made it a challenge.'
  - There were some delays in the delivery of construction materials, mainly due to COVID-19 related constrains, such as travel/transportation restrictions, challenges in sourcing, not availability of items etc. which caused the delay in the implementation of the project.

  items:
  - Lack of trained volunteers to implement the project under the operations. Another challenge was the sustainability of skilled and capable volunteers. Volunteer turnover is a common problem in most of the areas, where volunteers leave for work or migrate. In addition, some of the volunteers were not aware of all existing policies for emergency operations (SOP and policies).
  - Overlapping of activities (conflict of schedule between community and chapters).
  - The CSG and CMLP are in their exploration stage, thus issues are anticipated to arise. Implementing chapters and groups mentioned the need for improved project guidelines, monitoring tools, and progress assessment among others. At present PRC is revising/upgrading the guidelines with technical support from IFRC Livelihood Centre.

  items:
  - Most of the staff and volunteers were trained only on emergency response but were not trained to provide other services (i.e., PFA, CFS, health service,). Hence, number of equipped volunteers with knowledge to provide initial response to individuals experiencing psychological distress were limited.
  - Limitation on the movement due to pandemic. Staff and volunteers have encountered risk contracting COVID-19 during operation. Necessary protocols were put in place to lessen the risk.
