  - After completion of the emergency activities, BDRCS started implementing the recovery operation. However, since the beginning of March 2021, the number of COVID-19 positive cases and death started increasing again sharply. Due to the strict movement restriction across the country and considering the safety of staff and volunteers, the overall consultation and assessment process in the communities were delayed and it took longer time than expected to identify the targeted communities and targeted households for recovery assistance.
  - Based on the operational plan and request from BDRCS, IFRC CD initiated the procurement process and issued the work order to deliver roofing materials. However, there was a shortage of imported raw materials due to restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the supplier was unable to supply on time. As a result, in consultation with communities and assessing local markets, BDRCS provided additional cash assistance to buy roofing materials for houses.
  - On the other hand, opening individual bank accounts was slower than expected as the bank authority allowed only limited beneficiaries at the bank due to the COVID-19 safety measures. BDRCS continued promoting and ensuring the COVID-19 safety measures throughout the implementation of shelter recovery, including training, focus group discussion, construction, etc.
  - However, BDRCS and IFRC operational team provided inclusive monitoring and technical support virtually and physically as required and possible. BDRCS field team paid an extra effort to complete the scheduled task through engaging the community development committee, community organizers and local Red Crescent branch.

For these reasons, BDRCS conducted a technical assessment and installed 25 rainwater harvesting units during the emergency phase. During the recovery phase, BDRCS installed another 250 rainwater harvesting units.
  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and difficult access to the remote affected communities, the overall planned activities like technical assessment and focus group discussions were not completed in a timely manner. As a result, overall WASH recovery interventions were delayed.
  - BDRCS also could not recruit a WASH technical officer who was supposed to be based at the field. BDRCS instead deployed the WASH Officer from the Disaster Response Department, based at the NHQ level, where he provided technical and monitoring support, both virtually and physically as required.

  - Diversified challenges were captured in the lesson learned workshop, such as delay of implementation during recovery and emergency phase, the opening of bank accounts and transferring funds in a timely manner, remote geographical location with limited transport facilities, extreme weather patterns, etc. It was also highlighted that the targeted people had to travel long distances to get the banking service and experienced irregular banking hours, shortage in the local market due to strict lockdown.
  - During the implementation of recovery interventions, BDRCS had to manage multiple emergency operations, as a result, human resources of the BDRCS disaster response department were stretched and experienced difficulties to complete the operation within the original time frame.
