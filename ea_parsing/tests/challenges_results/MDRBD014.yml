  - Initially, the decision was to set up Kit-5 water treatment plants at each of
    the four districts mentioned. After the installation and running of the first
    Kit-5 at Kurigram, it became clear that more beneficiaries would be able to benefit
    from the safe drinking water distributions if mobile kits were used as they were
    smaller in size and could be transported to the islands in boats. As the families
    received purified water, distribution of water purification tablets was no longer
    required.
  - Finding an appropriate location for the suppliers for the construction of ring
    slabs was also a challenge as it was difficult to find a location which had plenty
    of water supply, power supply and proper road accessibility, and at the same time
    convenient for the beneficiaries. However, after several joint field surveys by
    the suppliers and the district branches, the locations were identified and the
    sites were handed over.
  - Because of the recent flood in July 2015 the installation of ring-slab and fixing
    of the superstructure were heavily affected, as it was not possible to excavate
    the latrine pits due to the stagnant floodwater.
