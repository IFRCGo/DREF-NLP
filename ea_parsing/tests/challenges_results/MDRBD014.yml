  - Initially, the decision was to set up Kit-5 water treatment plants at each of the four districts mentioned. After the installation and running of the first Kit-5 at Kurigram, it became clear that more beneficiaries would be able to benefit from the safe drinking water distributions if mobile kits were used as they were smaller in size and could be transported to the islands in boats. As the families received purified water, distribution of water purification tablets was no longer required.
  - Finding an appropriate location for the suppliers for the construction of ring slabs was also a challenge as it was difficult to find a location which had plenty of water supply, power supply and proper road accessibility, and at the same time convenient for the beneficiaries. However, after several joint field surveys by the suppliers and the district branches, the locations were identified and the sites were handed over.
  - Because of the recent flood in July 2015 the installation of ring-slab and fixing of the superstructure were heavily affected, as it was not possible to excavate the latrine pits due to the stagnant floodwater.
