  items:
  - 'Lack of Warehouse Facilities: One significant challenge encountered was the absence of warehouse facilities at the BDRCS branch level for storing relief items. Consequently, BDRCS had to mobilize relief items such as tarpaulins, shelter toolkits, sleeping mats, etc., from its central warehouse facilities.'
  - 'Difficulty in Road Access: Accessing the operation location by road was challenging due to inundation and adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall leading to muddy roads and high temperatures. Nonetheless, BDRCS organized locally available transportation options like boats and rickshaw vans to deliver relief items to the affected people.'
  - 'Limited Transportation Access in Remote Areas: In remote haor locations like Telikhal and Companiganj, there was limited transportation access by road, particularly for delivering corrugated iron sheets. In consultation with local communities, BDRCS arranged distribution points as close as possible to the targeted communities. Simultaneously, BDRCS emphasized a cash-based intervention, allowing targeted households to procure locally available items.'
  - 'Resource Constraints: BDRCS faced challenges in meeting the needs of a large number of affected people with limited available resources. To address these challenges, BDRCS maintained regular coordination and consultation with local communities, humanitarian agencies, and the government. BDRCS prioritized the most affected communities in coordination with relevant stakeholders and identified the most vulnerable affected households through multisectoral household assessments. Throughout the operation, a feedback and complaint mechanism was established between the community and BDRCS to address this challenge.'

  - During the initial relief phase, BDRCS encountered difficulties in reaching flood-affected communities with food assistance. This was primarily due to inundation, a lack of transportation options, and limited market accessibility. To address this situation, BDRCS engaged the support of nearby branches unaffected by floods. These branches procured food items and delivered them to the flood-affected districts.
  - Volunteers and staff in respective severely flood affected districts experienced challenges to communicate using mobile phone and computer as there was several days without electricity and mobile network was disrupted.

  sector_title: Multi-Purpose Cash
  items:
  - "\u2022 Considering the national cash working recommended package, BDRCS initially provided a multipurpose cash grant of BDT 4,500 per household. However, both the evaluation and PDM revealed that this cash assistance was insufficient to meet the needs."
  - As a result, there is a recommendation to increase the multipurpose cash package, taking into account the market prices of essential items and inflation. Based on updated information from the Household Economic Survey (HES), the CWG is currently in the process of raising the MPCG package from BDT 4,500 to BDT 6,000. This adjustment aims to better enable people to meet their needs, and the guidelines for this increase are expected to be published by December 2023.
  - "\u2022 BDRCS volunteers, NDRT members, and staff faced significant challenges in conducting household assessments due to factors such as remoteness, inundation, and transportation limitations. Nevertheless, with the dedicated support of local volunteers, BDRCS persevered in carrying out the assessments and finalizing the selection of targeted households for cash assistance."

  sector_title: Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
  items:
  - The planned targets could not be reached due to low funding coverage, representing only 30 per cent of the total IFRC EA ask.
  - Since the Sylhet region had not experienced such severe floods in the last couple of decades, BDRCS had limited capacity in the flood-affected districts to provide WASH services in emergencies. In the most severely flooded districts, such as Sylhet and Sunamganj, there were no water purification units available. Consequently, BDRCS had to deploy mobile water purification units from its national headquarters located in Dhaka.
  - A significant number of sanitation facilities had been damaged, and according to the BDRCS assessment, a large portion of the affected people could not construct latrines without external support. BDRCS faced challenges in identifying the limited number of targeted households that required latrine support from the large, affected population. To overcome this challenge, BDRCS conducted household assessments in the most affected areas in coordination with local government and other humanitarian agencies, utilizing its limited resources.
