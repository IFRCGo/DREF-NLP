  items:
  - The main challenge concerned sustaining the operation. Some branches were affected economically by not being able to achieve the sale of services to support themselves, as they were focused on assisting the migrants. The most serious case was the La Cruz de Guanacaste branch in Costa Rica, which had almost all its staff focused on assisting the migrants, and during the fourth month of the emergency, the branch suffered a financial crisis, from which is it is still recovering.
  - The second challenge was the reduction in the number of CRRC volunteer staff, which affected the operations, as there was a need to transfer staff from different regions to facilitate the continued implementation of the operation, thereby increasing operational costs.
  - "RCSP personnel need to strengthen their knowledge and training in the IFRC\u2019s psychosocial support tools. In health promotion and prevention, the challenge has been logistical difficulties and access issues, and the health interventions have been limited to the visits in which Ministry of Health personnel were present. The same challenge has befallen pre-hospital care, as the migrants were in remote areas."

  items:
  - 'There were few achievements in this section due to the following issues:'
  - "\u2022 When the operation was about to renovate the collective centres, the Cuban migrants started to leave the country; thus, only two of the collective centres were successfully renovated: the sanitary facilities, drains and laundry facilities were repaired in Parrita, Puntarenas, and the drainage, laundry facilities and showers were repaired in the shelter in El Roble de Puntarenas."
  - "\u2022 Going from several collective centres at the beginning to managing 4 collective centres shelters and later 2 CATEMs made it difficult to determine where to invest funds due to the short amount of time available for actions."
  - "\u2022 Engaging in advocacy actions to improve the migrants\u2019 conditions. Although local authorities were aware of the Sphere Project standards, the conditions in Costa Rica did not necessarily adapt to the Humanitarian Charter, and this was the main challenge; this mostly concerned water and sanitation issues, which always involved many discussions; however, having fewer collective centres made it easier to engage in advocacy actions to help achieve these improvements."
  - "Panama In Bar\xFA, due to logistical challenges, the hygiene talks had to be conducted on the same day as the delivery of the hygiene kits."
  - "The number of people initially targeted for the receipt of hygiene kits was 1,401 people; however, 1,241 people received hygiene kits in the end due to fluctuations in the collective centres\u2019 population."

  sector_title: Shelter, Housing and Settlements
  items:
  - The lack of training in shelter management was a major challenge, as the paucity of staff with shelter management knowledge meant that they were overwhelmed by the demand for services in the centres.
  - "The lack of economic resources was another of the challenges faced in the provision of the assistance required by the migrants; however, strengthening the efforts of everyone involved helped generate contributions that improved the migrants\u2019 conditions in Costa Rica and Panama."

  sector_title: Food insecurity and nutrition
  items:
  - Maintaining the established standards for the provision of the minimum quantity of daily calories to the migrants and receiving support from the government in the form of donated food items were challenges.
  - Costa Rica Registering people has proven to be a challenge due to the constant rotation of people in the collective centres; however, coordination has been maintained with Costa Rican immigration authorities to keep track of the list of people who have been housed and received food.

  sector_title: Quality Programming
  items:
  - "The lack of experience in working with migrants and managing migration flows was the main challenge the National Societies faced. Since Costa Rica and Panama were often not the migrants\u2019 final destination, the migration patterns were unusual, as unique the number of migrants in the countries could considerably diminish in less than a week, or there could be a surge in the population in a single location if there was a sudden influx of migrants; these rapid changes in the population required swift deployments of personnel and provided little time for planning, which proved to be logistically challenging."
  - The language barrier was a very significant challenge; originally it was not a problem because the migrants were mainly native Spanish speakers; nonetheless, when the trans-continental migrants began arriving, it caused serious issues, as number of different languages spoken by the migrants swelled to five (Spanish; English; French; Portuguese; and Creole).
