  - With ten years passed since the last large scale disaster for VNRC provinces in the Mekong Delta, it has been only natural that challenges in capacity and ability to respond quickly were identified and highlighted during the VNRC review meeting.
  - Moving forward, VNRC, IFRC and PNS identified areas that needed further investment to turn challenges into positive outcomes. These included damage and needs assessment techniques and skills, which were weak needed to be strengthened especially at the branch level in order to improve and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of information collection, which in turn facilitated a better analysis process.
  - Essential relief items to be prepositioned in the future and made ready for immediate distribution, as well as an effective coordination towards the common goal should be agreed upon for prompt action.

  - Due to increased cases of HFMD and dengue and the potential disease outbreaks after the flood, VNRC was able to incorporate HFMD and dengue prevention messages in this Mekong flood operation. VNRC was able to deploy active trainers to train volunteers and roll out behaviour change activities in communes with high number of HFMD cases. However, due to time limitations, activities such as monitoring behaviour change needs improvement. In addition, behaviour change requires follow-up and repeated key messages for households in high risk areas, VNRC will need to continue integrating health education, particularly hand-washing into its long- term program such as risk reduction and community-based health. Another area that remains a challenge for VNRC is better coordination and integration of emergency health and disaster response in term of approach, and operational mechanism. During the operation, it is observed that systems for disease/epidemic and disaster tracking needs to be better coordinated for more effective response. Similarly, continuing having disaster management and emergency health unit working together in planning and execution of responses will help the operation more effective and timely to the end-user beneficiaries. The shortcomings around coordination has been taken into consideration, to be addressed in the longer-term programme, through further improvement of inter-department collaboration in VNRC before and during disasters.

  - "During the operation, it shows that VNRC\u201Fs capacity in water and sanitation response in emergency has been improved through deployment of equipment and team to the affected area shortly after the disaster. The shortcoming in the deployment is the need to carry out a thorough needs assessment before the deployment. Although a general assessment was included in all training for trainers over the years, however, it was more focused on assessment of water source. Thus, in the long-term water and sanitation and disaster management programme, it is needed to bring in identified lesson-learned from previous operation and more practical sessions on need assessment covering needs and conditions for water treatment unit deployment."
  - At operational level, VNRC used the same trained volunteers for emergency health for raising awareness of community in prevention of water-borne diseases. On one hand, it is good for efficiency as volunteers were equipped with a wider knowledge of disease prevention and health education, thus expanding their education activities for affected communes. The volunteers were also able to quickly carry out awareness raising activities and campaigns in target communes shortly after the operation was started. On the other hand, the workload for volunteers was a lot more, and as a result, monitoring of behaviour change among target families was not adequately emphasized and implemented. Sanitation and hygiene promotion was also an area that interventions were not intensified in the actual execution, limiting the impact of the overall responses in water and sanitation in emergency. Again, the lessons learned around monitoring and having a disease and disaster tracking system for timely and effectively response will need to be considered and addressed through the longer-term capacity building and development programme.

  - 'Design: Allocation of funds and the initial of agreement on the design, size and total funding contribution was a challenge faced at the early onset. In spite of VNRC, IFRC and PNS agreeing on an improved approach from experience of Ketsana, there still remained a challenge around the allocated budget being insufficient during the implementation phase. This was very much variation to differences in the 3 locations, inflation and cost for suppliers and labor. Adjustments were made throughout the implementation phase in order to address these challenges.'
  - 'Supervision: Average construction time per house in the programme was some 45 days. Construction site was scattered over the three provinces and accessible mainly by boats. Given such a workload of the DWF supervisors, it was evident that it was not possible to fully meet the requirements of the Instruction of Supervision. Weekly visits would not be sufficient to provide adequate control of the works: a position borne out by the errors identified. Acknowledging a lack of supervision and accountability to beneficiaries, VNRC, with the support from IFRC, strengthened its ongoing monitoring to the work to ensure the quality of the construction as well as the progress of the programme. It was worth noting that each shelter focal person paid his minimum 5 visits per house within the programme timeframe.'
  - 'Partnership: Taking the advantage of experience gained in the Ketsana recovery programme in 2009, VNRC focused into further investment in building its technical capacity in terms of shelter programming locally through partnership with DWF. A notable difference to the Ketsana programme was the more involved role of VNRC, demonstrating a growing capacity and confidence as the programme progressed. Key stakeholders described changes to the roles and responsibilities, but the MOU was adopted without significant modification. The complexity in the relationship of the primary stakeholders created some gaps in management, responsibility, and accountability. This related also to the reporting mechanisms. Efforts were made through the implementation phase in order to optimize the gaps.'
  - Finance management support - The capacity of the householders to manage additional construction work outside of the agreed design for extensions and alterations varied from household to household, and was an area that VNRC recognized additional support and close monitoring by project staff.
  - It was also recognized that for future projects there remained an opportunity in further expansions of the shelter programme to include a component on project and financial management for beneficiaries, to ensure that they fully understand the implications of the owner driven housing project, and any the importance in financial management if additional work is to be carried out.

  - It was obvious that VNRC faced challenges in disaster response preparedness capacity as well as ability to respond quickly to disasters among VNRC staff and volunteers given the last large scale disaster in the Mekong Delta region ten years back. Taking into consideration, the unpredictability of disasters and the ever growing impact of climate change, it is crucial to have a long term investment in disaster preparedness for all provinces across the country. Enhancing VNRC and community capacities to cope and respond to disasters contributes to saving lives, speeds up recovery and reduces the impact of future hazards.
