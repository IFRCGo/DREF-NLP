  - "The delayed funds transfer from IFRC to NRCS for timely cash transfer has affected the possibility of program impacting beneficiaries. Lack of confirmation of funding for extended Cash Transfer and Water and Sanitation intervention in the region has affected the timely implementation of the interventions. Further to that, limited allocated financial support to the Cash Transfer proved a challenge to allow flexibility to for example accommodate destitute people. The rapid field assessment has pinpointed a number of destitute pastoralists living in peri-urban settlements lacking access to basic services and infrastructure. Despite increasing the targeted number of households from 1000 to 1,100 to allow the project to provide critical livelihood protection and food consumption support for the some of the very poorest; this was not sufficient to reach more people and have a meaningful impact resulting in office frequenting out of hope for new registrations. The initial budget allocation for Cash Transfer planned to provide only NAD 450 per household as opposed to the current market cost of basket items of NAD 700 (CHF 52). In addition, the initial proposal did not consider the 20% Commission to the third party, resulting in significant budget impact. Late and irregular disbursement of cash from IFRC to NRCS and subsequent reports clearing before the next cash request is approved highly impacted the smooth operations, resulting in the risk of ruining the reputation of the National Society with beneficiaries\u2019 and stakeholders. This further could dent the perception towards cash transfer as a humanitarian response tool especially in a country like Namibia where it is poorly tested."

  - The insufficient funding of the EPoA resulted in farmers training and provision of farming inputs in all targeted regions not being carried out. Those conducted in Kavango were a result of the SRCS contribution to its already existing programs. In addition to that, the availability of quality seeds in the local market at a timely basis provided challenge to the NS, resulting in late training of targeted beneficiaries and provision of seeds having to be imported from Zambia.

  items:
  - The revised EPoA included WASH promotion, of which a substantial time was spent on further developing a proposal for WASH integration on the promise it was going to be funded and this did not materialize. As a result, WASH promotion was short of funding and had to be sacrificed to accommodate the financial costs associated with implementing the Cash Transfer. This then means that the risks associated with water borne diseases could not be implemented for mitigation. The sparsely distribution of inadequate small numbers of targeted beneficiaries (small numbers per village result in short period spent by payment teams, limit engagement period) across the constituencies together with lack of health messages affected the integration of the health component of the program. NRCS plan to revisit the health messaging component of the program in such a way that beneficiaries receive sensitisation including during short period of payments in villages during the payments. Lack of funding to procure hygiene promotion items has resulted in omission of health messaging during the first payment.
