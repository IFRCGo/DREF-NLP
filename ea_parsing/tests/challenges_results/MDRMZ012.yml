    cash transfer. After an assessment that was carried out by the CVM, it was noted
    that nearly 80 percent of intended programme beneficiaries did not have access
    to a cell phone and that the only mobile service provider in the country with
    network coverage in the target districts did not have a cash transfer service
    established. This affected the initial plan and the National Society with support
    from the cluster office resorted to use the voucher system to support the targeted
    districts.
  - "The second challenge was the issue of changes in price of the basic commodities\
    \ in Mozambique. It should be noted that due to commodity price variations over\
    \ time and fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar, the contract value\
    \ with the Appeal\u2019s food suppliers is re-examined every three months by CVM."
  - The other challenge had to do with expectations of the communities with regards
    of the support that the Red Cross could provide. Due to limited funding of the
    appeal, there was a challenge initially when the CVM could not support all the
    targeted beneficiaries. At the onset of the response, CHF 380,000 was confirmed
    for the operation, which allowed for the targeting of 1,335 households (6,675
    people) between July and September 2016 against 2,953 households which the CVM
    had initially identified. Expectations were raised on the support that the Red
    Cross could give to the communities and this posed a challenge to the CVM. However,
    when extra funding was raised for the Appeal, the National Society was able to
    support the remainder of the beneficiaries.
  - The National Society was also not able to support the implementation of the supplementary-feeding
    component of the operation due to limited funding and because there were other
    organizations like WFP who were better placed to implement the component and already
    had the required support and infrastructure to do so.
  - During the Operation, Mozambique also faced a new challenge posed by the Cyclone
    Dineo. This affected some of the districts where the operation was being implemented,
    impacting on crop production, destroying homes and increasing the vulnerable communities.
    As such the impact of the Appeal was somehow eroded and there is a great need
    to continue supporting the communities so that they become more resilient.
