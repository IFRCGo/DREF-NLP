  items:
  - With worsening of the situation in Iraq and the due Ninewa liberation campaign ahead of us, IRCS needs to get prepared and pre-positioned with needed relief in strategic warehouses. In general due to the long lasting nature of the crisis, IRCS has depleted major relief stocks in food, NFI and hygiene. IRCS set reserve was 10,000 food and NFI at all time as stocks to be kept in warehouses. Now, this level is radically down in the very face of the new, expected crisis in Mosul, Ninewa. In the particularly underfunded IFRC-IRCS emergency appeal, it has been a challenge to meet the target, expectations towards IFRC to provide relief to IRCS with the ultimate goal to deliver services at very time of the needs emerge.
  - "As the situation it is at the time of drafting this paper/report, neither IFRC, not IRCS is in the position to express that \u201Cready for response action\u201D. Leftover on MDRIQ 007 was transferred and charged to the new emergency appeal MDRIQ 008 with still low funding pattern."
  - Humanitarian access to hot spot areas of Iraq is limited or not accessible due to the known situation. IRCS is being challenged and do well delivering services and relief to the needy.
