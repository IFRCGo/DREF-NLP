  - Hiring of Financial Service Provider (FSP) for the cash assistance has been a major challenge. Despite the fact that tendering process has been done in a timely manner and after long negotiations with the selected FSP regarding the contractual details of the cash distribution, Albanian Red Cross decided not to move on in the collaboration with this provider. This decision came since the agency has been procrastinating and did not show sufficient level of seriousness and interest in this collaboration.
  - As an alternative solution to move as quickly as possible with the cash distribution, ARC together with the IFRC country team decided to use bank cheques modality (directly from the ARC bank account opened specifically for the CVA program). ARC has a previous experience using this modality, which has led to a smooth and successful implementation of the three planned rounds of distribution during the reporting period.
  - An unexpected challenge for the CVA intervention was the situation created by COVID-19 pandemic which caused delays in the start of the distribution, as proper procedures and equipment to protect staff, volunteers and the affected population had to be designed, procured and implemented.
  - To mitigate the risk of the COVID 19 infection among ARC staff and volunteers as well as the recipients during the distributions, PPEs (i.e. gloves, mask) were distributed for the selected households, physical distance was maintained and the households were invited for the distributions in pre-set time slots to avoid large gatherings.
  - It was noticed during the first round of distribution that some of the selected HHs left the country. To overcome this challenge, HHs were selected from the waiting list based on vulnerability criteria scoring system.

  - Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 crisis and associated measures (such as restriction of movement, closure of all schools, cancellation of mass gatherings), some originally planned Health and PSS activities that are community based could not be carried out as originally planned. Events with the involvement of many unknown people are stressful, and the psychosocial dimensions of this outbreak needs to be addressed early to minimize individual and population-based anxiety that may pose a threat to public health and safety.
  - PSS interventions which were modified to the new conditions have been continuing, mostly online and through social media channels in order to mitigate the impact of the earthquake, as well as COVID-19 and its restrictions at the same time.
