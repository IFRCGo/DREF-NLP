  - The unpredictability of the Ebola outbreak and the lack of knowledge about management of this sort of outbreak was a major challenge at all levels. The Ebola operation demanded high level logistics and human resource capacity (e.g. Procurement of SDB materials and equipment in Guinea or the setting up Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone).
  - Continuous improvement of protocols and training on Ebola responses for National Society staff and volunteers was necessary, while finding adequate human resources profiles and proficient volunteer management was difficult.
  - Recruitment was very challenging because of the fear and stigma attached to the Ebola virus disease, language barriers, and travel advisories constraining access to the affected countries.
  - Staff turnover, sometimes due to poaching of Red Cross staff and volunteers by other agencies, increased the burden on recruitment, orientation and training. Trauma among posted staff, as well as misinformation about the disease, presented challenges to HR management.

  - Scientific knowledge underpinning Red Cross approaches seriously conflicted with traditional knowledge and cultures that were governing individual and community behaviour in the affected areas. There was widespread distrust of externally generated information because of the recent civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, when information was misused by the warring parties for their own interests.
  - In the initial phases of the response to the Ebola outbreak, one-way communication dominated, and messages were not adapted to the local context. This top-down messaging resulted from the urgency of raising awareness and understanding in affected communities, but as it usually did not have time to consider local knowledge and perspectives, the messages did not often work. Furthermore, there was no partner coordination on messaging, resulting in mixed messages being received by communities.
  - 'Apart from messaging causing prolonged denial and anger, it also unintentionally created stigma for Ebola survivors: Ebola is a killer disease, if you are affected you will die - therefore, people felt that even if you recovered from Ebola, you would still die, in this mal-informed perspective.'
