  items:
  - The limited funding of this appeal proved the main challenge, which limited the possibility to comprehensively respond to the food security crisis.
  - In regards to provision of the food aid, the initial plan was to provide food items including cereals, pulse (lentils), salt, oil and sugar over a three months period in a single distribution for 12,800 households. Instead, due to funding constrains, it was only possible to provide one food item (sorghum) for 6000 households (30,000 individuals) beside the food rations distributed. Fortunately, the government managed to supplement the distribution with vegetable oil and sugar, and UNICEF provided support towards the nutrition centres. Moreover, funds constraints affected the recruitment process of the staff which was solved by using the available staff from the SRCS.
