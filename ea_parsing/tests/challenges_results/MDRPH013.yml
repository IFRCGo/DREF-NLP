Specifically, 1,700 families were reached with shelter repair assistance while 304 households were provided with core shelters.

  - The core shelter intervention was adversely affected during the rainy and typhoon seasons, delaying construction completion. Delivery of construction materials was also a challenge, especially for beneficiaries living in remote areas, due to accessibility constraints. Excavation for septic tanks, which are integral to core shelters, was very difficult, especially in the municipality of Loon. This is due to the hard rock and limestone geological composition of these areas in Bohol. Despite these challenges, the programme was completed within timeframe.
  - The overall target for shelter interventions was to provide 2,300 families with durable shelter. The coverage of this appeal reached 87 per cent, leaving a significant funding gap. As such, only 2,004 families were provided with shelter assistance; specifically, 1,700 with shelter repair and 304 with core shelter.
  - Rehabilitation of water and sanitation facilities in schools was initially scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2014. However, delays were faced in engaging a suitable contractor; the bidding process took longer than expected with an unexpected change of contractors which disrupted the project schedule. This prompted a re-bidding exercise, which eventually saw the engagement of a suitable contractor who undertook the entire rehabilitation project. Other challenges to this project included digging through a solid foundation of limestone and the disruption of the construction schedule by the rainy season. Nevertheless, work has since been completed satisfactorily, with all the facilities handed over to the respective school authorities in November 2014 and currently being utilized.
