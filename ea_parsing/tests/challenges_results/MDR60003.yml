  - "There was delay in the start of the operations hence it led to hurried implementation and failure of the Federation to undertake National Society Development (in the implementation period August \u2013 December 2017)"
  - With the donor (ICRC) restriction in geographical coverage and response options, communities accused the National Society of bias as well as offering them non-priority assistance
  - Low capacity of the National Societies to access hard-to reach areas led to reduction in geographical coverage and number of people reached by the interventions. Such can be perceived as bias and is damaging the National Society credibility as responder of first choice in disaster
  - The long targeting tools prolonged periods of beneficiary selection
  - Serious security problems at the border between Oromia and Somali regions of Babile woreda jeopardize the operation for 2 months
  - Frequent turnover of government higher officials, especially of conflict induced areas of Somali & Oromia region created a communication gap
  - Revision of the operational plan of conducting water tracking created dissatisfaction among the community (e.g. Afar, Kuri district)
  - Delay in budget transfer and budget settlement from the concerned bodies affected the performance of the implementation
  - The changeover in Government administration in Somaliland has impacted on the speed at which SRCS is able to obtain customs clearance and tax exemption for cargo clearing and transport of relief items into Puntland. As noted previously, the change-over in administration means the SRCS must develop new relationships with the incoming Government. IFRC Hargeisa is currently in negotiation with WFP regarding the re-shipment of cargo in Berbera to Bosasso in Puntland
  - A key development in January was the military confrontation between Somaliland and Puntland in the disputed territories in Sool and Sanaag which both Governments claim. This confrontation was prompted by the stated intention of the President of FRG in Mogadishu to visit territory in Sool accompanied by representatives of the Puntland administration. Military forces of Somaliland attacked and took control of territory previously controlled by Puntland. The Somaliland administration immediately began to reinforce its control of the area and at other points along the of January the Government of Puntland declared line of control (Sool and Sanaag) On the 13 war on Somaliland. In response the Government of Somaliland stated that it has no intention of attacking Puntland but will defend its territory which it defines as up the point of the colonially established border. The initial military operation has caused displacement of civilians within Sool. To date there have been ongoing low-level exchanges of artillery and gun fire between the opposing armies. As a result of this, the planned distribution of WASH/NFIs has been put on hold pending an assessment of the situation.
  - "Logistics \u2013 rain from July to November made overland transportation routes impossible to bypass. Flying supplies to hard-to-reach areas was the only possibility."
  - For the second year in a row in 2017, South Sudan was ranked as the most dangerous context for humanitarian workers in the world, having reported the highest frequency of attacks on aid staffers. The operations had to be adaptable to the changing security environment in the areas of implementation. This posed challenges to planning.
  - The SSRC is a young national society that is still working on enhancing its capacity, systems and infrastructure.
