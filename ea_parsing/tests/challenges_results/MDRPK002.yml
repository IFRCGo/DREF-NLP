  - Extreme cold weather was an ongoing challenge for the PRCS/International Federation
    relief teams. This also allowed PRCS/International Federation personnel to lead
    a number of families in their migration to lower grounds.
  - Another challenge was timely delivery of the procured items in Quetta and Ziarat.
    Apart from delays of a couple of days for some items, suppliers were very much
    on schedule.

    \ However, the PRCS/International Federation dissemination teams helped in neutralizing\

  - There was some dissonance between the NDMA/PDMA and the PRCS/International Federation.
    This was because there was a confusion between the construction of an emergency
    shelter as opposed to simple construction or the construction of basic housing.
    Persistent advocacy at coordination meetings in Islamabad and Quetta brought the
    frequency of the government authorities in accordance with the PRCS/International
    Federation to some extent.
