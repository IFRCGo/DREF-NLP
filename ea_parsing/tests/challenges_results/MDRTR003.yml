  - "The initial response focused on the provision of humanitarian assistance in temporary accommodation centres. This changed with a realisation of the protracted nature of the refugee situation and the shift from large numbers to urban areas, which meant that the support provided needed to be adapted to the changing needs. For more details, please refer to Operations Update 1 \u2013 10."

  items:
  - There were some challenges related to the retention of volunteers. While recruiting health volunteers from both the Syrian and Turkish communities was relatively straightforward, it proved difficult to retain them. There were also more female volunteers than male, which posed problems when conducting household visits and other community outreach activities, as female volunteers sometimes prefer not to engage with male beneficiaries due to cultural sensitivities. Staffing was also a challenge. There were not always enough staff at different levels. For example, finding interpreters who had the necessary technical expertise for PSS activities was challenging.
  - There was usually a significantly lower number of men engaged in PSS due to the cultural perception that such activities were more appropriate for women. TRCS staff tried to adapt vocational training in such instances to include PSS and health components to engage men, even at a less in-depth level.
  - Due to lack of Internet access and that some beneficiaries live in places where connectivity is a problem, there were technical difficulties in online interviews, or meetings had to be cancelled. In this context, the number of psychoeducation participants has been limited.
  - In addition, there were difficulties because of the limited number of available telephone devices, and not all of these are not suitable for online calls.

  items:
  - Delay in recruitment was a major challenge. Given how meticulous the TRCS recruitment system was, together with government authority requirements, it appeared that the allocated three-month period for recruitment was insufficient to have qualified and adequate staff in place.
  - Late approval of Individual Protection Assistance (IPA) guidelines by ECHO contributed towards low expenditure under this activity at the beginning of the project. A lack of clarity around how the IPA was to be applied also caused staff to use other funds which are less restrictive, for the sake of expedience.
  - The value of the Turkish Lira (TRY) fluctuated greatly throughout the project implementation period. From beginning 2018, the TRY went down to record lows against other major international currencies, including the EUR, CHF, USD. The exchange gain from EUR to TRY which was also reflected in low expenditure rates resulted in large surplus funds. It was not anticipated that TRY would be devalued in such a manner, and while implementation picked up in Year 2 of the project, it was not possible to spend the total original budget due to this monetary discrepancy, coupled with protracted delays in project implementation.
  - From mid-March 2020 onwards, all protection activities normally conducted by the CCs were severely curbed by government restrictions on movement throughout the country due to the COVID 19 pandemic. To overcome this unforeseen situation CC staff also began working from home and providing services on online platform, and on shifts at the CCs in case of emergencies.

  items:
  - New staff recruitment was delayed and affected the implementation of some interventions. Many of the programme sectors experienced a steady turnover of staff, which often included trained staff leaving, and new/junior staff requiring specific orientation and training to fulfil capacity for adequate service delivery. A comprehensive induction training for new staff and volunteers were regularly held, providing basic information on the RCRC Movement, TRCS regulation and procedures as well as their role and responsibilities. Other trainings and workshops were conducted across livelihoods, health and PSS, and social cohesion to strengthen TRCS` capacity and enhance their ability to reach out to most vulnerable groups within refugees and host communities included. Staff and volunteers were also encouraged to participate in other learning resources available online to build the skills and knowledge for better and more efficient service delivery.
  - Capacity building was severely curtailed in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Under this Appeal, some trainings were conducted in direct relation to supporting response efforts to the pandemic situation.
