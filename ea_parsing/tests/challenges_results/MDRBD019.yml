  - Due to limited funds, not all targeted HHs/people were possible to be reached. On the other hand, the whole procurement process of CGI sheets took more than two months and as a result, the distribution was delayed. Similarly, BDRCS local branches experienced difficulties to stock large number of CGIs due to lack of proper storage facilities. However, the increased technical specifications for CGI led to delays in procurement linked to quality control, but the benefits outweighed the delays.
  - IFRC also experienced difficulties to transfer funds in timely manner due to long financial procedure. Later, both BDRCS and IFRC coordinated with respective financial service providers to minimise the delay in fund transfer.
  - During the post distribution monitoring, it was recommended by community people to exclude some of the items of shelter toolkits like hoe and shovel. As a result, IFRC Bangladesh country office requested IFRC APRO to procure customized shelter toolkits considering the context of Bangladesh. Due to the customized specification, IFRC APRO logistic unit could not mobilize IFRC standard shelter toolkits from their existing prepositioned stocks. IFRC APRO logistic unit received these customized shelter toolkits once the supplier produced the same with revised requirement. As a result, the replenishment of shelter toolkits took longer time than expected.
