  items:
  - Due to often occurrence of floods in the areas of interventions, communities have
    over time developed high expectations from National, County Governments and other
    actors on the ground during the response phase.
  - Inadequate IEC materials to compliment community health education and hygiene
    promotion sessions.
  - Community ownership to water and sanitation structures and facilities is still
    an issue and as such the sustainability of these actions will need to be strengthened
    on an ongoing basis.
  - Due to stringent measures to prevent spread of the COVID-19 not all planned outreach
    activities could be undertaken in person, so KRCS staff were forced to undertake
    some activities through calling beneficiaries and over-reliance on IEC materials.
