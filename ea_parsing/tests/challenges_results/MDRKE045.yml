  items:
  - Due to often occurrence of floods in the areas of interventions, communities have over time developed high expectations from National, County Governments and other actors on the ground during the response phase.
  - Inadequate IEC materials to compliment community health education and hygiene promotion sessions.
  - Community ownership to water and sanitation structures and facilities is still an issue and as such the sustainability of these actions will need to be strengthened on an ongoing basis.
  - Due to stringent measures to prevent spread of the COVID-19 not all planned outreach activities could be undertaken in person, so KRCS staff were forced to undertake some activities through calling beneficiaries and over-reliance on IEC materials.
