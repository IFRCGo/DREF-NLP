  - 'Relief distributions were complicated by:'
  - "\u2022 Difficult road access to accommodation centres"
  - "\u2022 Lack of trucks"
  - "\u2022 Lack of readily available relief stock"
  - "\u2022 Shifting numbers of potential beneficiaries at the camps."
  - "Some accommodation centres remained inaccessible until early April and goods had to be transported via air \u2013 thereby increasing the frequency and affecting the low daily volume of distributions. In total, close to 220 distributions were made - half of which were by helicopter."
  - The total number of families in accommodation centres increased over time, presumably as some families were drawn to the centres by on-going food and non-food relief distributions, regardless of whether they were affected by the floods or not. The Red Cross decided to stick to its original targets with regard to beneficiary numbers as per its initial assessments; as a result, beneficiary 9 numbers were at times lower than figures provided by INGC or actual numbers of beneficiaries in the camps. In some cases, the Red Cross divided rations so that every camp resident received support; in others, distributions were only made to families directly affected by the floods and already on Red Cross beneficiary lists.

  - "Red Cross shelter kits contained tools to assist people in the construction of houses using locally available materials \u2013 as this was considered to be the most readily accessible and most practical construction method in the flood-affected areas. However, housing construction using traditional methods was slow to start, as affected families waited to see if they would receive further assistance from governmental authorities, including materials such as tin sheeting for roofing."
