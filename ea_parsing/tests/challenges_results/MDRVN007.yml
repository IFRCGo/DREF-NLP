  - Beneficiary selection The beneficiaries were selected through a process of joint decision-making between local Red Cross, community leaders and local authorities according to the guidelines provided by VNRC national headquarters. Although efforts were made to adhere to VNRC guidelines for cash distribution, in some cases it was difficult to do so. In some villages, there was a demand to share the allocated money among all households instead of a few selected. Thus, money was distributed among a larger number of households than there were on the beneficiary list, thereby reducing the amount of money that households were supposed to receive. Often community members hesitated in accepting support while other households in the same community did not. The review team also reported that in some cases, it was difficult for the parties concerned to come up with a beneficiary list that everyone agreed upon.
  - Further, while selecting households for the cash distribution, local authorities were faced with the dilemma of distributing money between richer households that had been badly affected by the floods and very poor households that had suffered fewer damages in the floods because they had fewer belongings to lose. In the guidelines for cash distribution, there was an additional criterion of providing grants to those who had received no support from Red Cross or any other agency as yet. These largely included richer households, because the poor affected households had already received support in the past. Thus, the post-distribution monitoring exercise found that cash had been granted to households that had recovered better than others. It has been reported that in some cases, it was difficult to come up with a beneficiary list that all parties concerned agreed on.
  - "The Ketsana operation final report pointed out that the national society needed to advocate the understanding of the \u201Cmost in need\u201D concept and build the national society\u2019s capacity in applying the Fundamental Principles while addressing local community member concerns. VNRC, with support from IFRC, is now working on revising the guidelines for beneficiary selection."
  - Monitoring Financial issues were not supervised at the same time that the relief programme was implemented. The requirements for missing or necessary accounting records and papers came a few months later after the relief programme was delivered. Also, although the officers were experienced in relief distribution, they had limited capacity in financial accounting. This challenge will be addressed through further training for Red Cross staff on cash distribution, financial management and monitoring.
