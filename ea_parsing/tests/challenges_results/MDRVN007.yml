  - Beneficiary selection The beneficiaries were selected through a process of joint
    decision-making between local Red Cross, community leaders and local authorities
    according to the guidelines provided by VNRC national headquarters. Although efforts
    were made to adhere to VNRC guidelines for cash distribution, in some cases it
    was difficult to do so. In some villages, there was a demand to share the allocated
    money among all households instead of a few selected. Thus, money was distributed
    among a larger number of households than there were on the beneficiary list, thereby
    reducing the amount of money that households were supposed to receive. Often community
    members hesitated in accepting support while other households in the same community
    did not. The review team also reported that in some cases, it was difficult for
    the parties concerned to come up with a beneficiary list that everyone agreed
    upon.
  - Further, while selecting households for the cash distribution, local authorities
    were faced with the dilemma of distributing money between richer households that
    had been badly affected by the floods and very poor households that had suffered
    fewer damages in the floods because they had fewer belongings to lose. In the
    guidelines for cash distribution, there was an additional criterion of providing
    grants to those who had received no support from Red Cross or any other agency
    as yet. These largely included richer households, because the poor affected households
    had already received support in the past. Thus, the post-distribution monitoring
    exercise found that cash had been granted to households that had recovered better
    than others. It has been reported that in some cases, it was difficult to come
    up with a beneficiary list that all parties concerned agreed on.
  - "The  Ketsana operation final report  pointed out that the national society needed\
    \ to advocate the understanding of the \u201Cmost in need\u201D concept and build\
    \ the national society\u2019s capacity in applying the Fundamental Principles\
    \ while addressing local community member concerns. VNRC, with support from IFRC,\
    \ is now working on revising the guidelines for beneficiary selection."
  - Monitoring Financial issues were not supervised at the same time that the relief
    programme was implemented. The requirements for missing or necessary accounting
    records and papers came a few months later after the relief programme was delivered.
    Also, although the officers were experienced in relief distribution, they had
    limited capacity in financial accounting. This challenge will be addressed through
    further training for Red Cross staff on cash distribution, financial management
    and monitoring.
