  - The Local Disaster Committees proved that they are the best response tool at the local level. In total, two RCST National Disaster Response teams (NDRT) and two LDCs were mobilized to extend a helping hand to the affected people. Community members and the Tajik National Society volunteers participated in distributing relief items, disseminating basic but essential messages on hygiene and disease prevention, and monitoring.
  - "Despite some new staff in the National Society, their lack of personal experience of such emergency operations, the on-job/on-spot training showed that \u201Clearning by doing\u201D was the best way to strengthen the National Society\u2019s response capacity."
  - The way that the information on relief was provided, i.e. preparation and proper pre-delivery distribution of coupons (talons) to targeted beneficiaries by RCST made the project implementation smoother. Each coupon was issued in the name of recipient (head of family) and had the exact information on the amount of items to be distributed, date, time and place. This procedure allowed any misunderstandings/or complaints regarding non-proper distribution of items or date/time and place from the site of beneficiaries to be avoided.
