  - "The activities carried out in the reporting period were successful, as the targeted beneficiaries during the emergency phase were reached and the National Society\u2019s capacity was strengthened. Looking ahead, the MRC with support from IFRC needs to elaborate a long-term resilience plan to support affected communities in Mauritania. Indeed, while this Emergency Appeal included resilience components (such as support to cooperatives) it mostly provided life-saving support for the 2018-2019 crisis. This operation has closed, while Mauritania will undoubtedly continue to face regular difficult lean seasons in future years."
