  items:
  - RCS will need to further strengthen its capacity by training more volunteers in areas relevant to emergency response and by prepositioning contingency stocks that can be immediately mobilised when the need emerges. In addition, the development of a contingency plan together with the relevant government authorities and main actors in emergencies in Serbia would also be beneficial.

  - "Throughout the course of implementation, it was recognised how important it is to be able to measure the impact of the efforts. Through local-level discussions with staff and volunteers implementing activities, it was agreed that a standardised system of measurement should be established \u2013 to be further refined in future psychosocial support activities with migrants."
  - As migrants now tend to stay longer in Serbia, it becomes clear that establishing networks and clear, sustainable communication channels between service providers from all sectors is essential in order to avoid duplicating the work and to ensure complementary services that will cumulatively impact the wellbeing of migrants.

  items:
  - Thanks to good cooperation between countries along the route and the announcements related to the number of refugees heading towards Serbia, the staff and volunteers of RCS received information on the estimated numbers and nationalities of the arriving migrants from the colleagues in neighbouring countries within the region, which made it easier to prepare adequate assistance in advance to address the needs of each specific group that was coming to the reception centres.

  items:
  - To enable RCS to respond in a timely and effective manner, even in a rapidly changing emergency situation, it needs to maintain a contingency stock of food. Additional training for already active volunteers and introductory trainings for new volunteers would also make the NS better-prepared.

  - Based on the above, it can be concluded that PSS and counselling was very much needed as an ongoing activity in all governmental centres for persons who are without news about their family members.

  items:
  - "\u2022 Closed borders cause migrants to find easier ways of getting out of Serbia, which makes them an easier target for traffickers as the migrants are seeking employment."
  - "\u2022 Unaccompanied and separated children are exposed to exploitation, abuse and trafficking. They are trying to earn money for the continuation of their journey or to pay for their travels to date. Very often, they are exploited by smugglers and manipulated into working for them."
  - "\u2022 In their desire to carry on their journey, and without information on the impossibility of leaving the human trafficking chain, migrants are more willing to accept exploitation as an inevitable \u201Cchallenge\u201D."
  - 'Based on recommendation contained in the U.S. TIP report, RCS could: increase the efforts to protect children and youth among migrants from human trafficking; contribute to better identification of victims among migrants by educating RCS staff that is working with them daily. target professionals who can encounter vulnerable individuals and potential victims of human trafficking including health care providers, social workers, and other professionals, in order to protect children and youth including unaccompanied minors. increase its efforts in prevention of labour exploitation by emphasising regular procedures of employment. Youths in general (including migrants), are not informed about licensed employment agencies, so it is necessary to approach them with adequate information and prevent labour exploitation'

  items:
  - To ensure timely and effective response to emergencies in the whole territory of the country, all local branches need to be involved in capacity building training.
  - To effectively address long-term needs resulting from the population movement, RCS capacity-building efforts (in areas such as DM, Health, Community Engagement, anti-trafficking, etc.) should be mainstreamed through the migration focal point, with a view to including migrants as a target group of thematic programmes.
