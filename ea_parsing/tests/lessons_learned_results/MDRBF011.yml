  items:
  - BRCS has been working in many partnerships within and outside the Movement and has at times been over extended causing several implementation delays of the Emergency Appeal.
  - 'The arrival of Malian refugees in regions already affected by drought and food insecurity was particularly demanding and required BRCS to engage in partnerships in both urban centres as well as extend its assistance to refugee camps in some 11 areas of interventions in the following sectors: core relief, education, food, health, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene. The BRCS was always at the first plan for humanitarian aid to refugees thanks to its volunteer network already on place.'
  - The scale of the humanitarian activities involving BRCS would have justified additional financial management support since the lateness of some financial reporting delayed the transfer of further operational funds.
  - Most of the new planned outcomes which were included in the revised appeal did not happen due to the lack of additional funding. The lesson learned should be to convince all stakeholders to remain focused on the initial emergency whilst consultation takes place with partners and donors to convince of the validity of the new priorities to be backed-up by funding.
