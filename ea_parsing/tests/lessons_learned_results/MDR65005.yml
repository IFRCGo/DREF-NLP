  items:
  - The nature of the operation requires continuous operational flexibility, e.g.,
    for changing timelines of vessel rotations, procurement processes with short lead
    time, the absence of a Host National Society, and the close collaboration with
    an external partner.
  - The operation offers an excellent opportunity for operational and systemic learning.
    Learning follows a structure of description of problems / challenges, subsequent
    problem analysis and solution / mitigation measures. A Lessons Learnt Register
    captures learnings and process optimization. Structured debriefings and reporting,
    and the continuous review of implementation processes and organizational challenges,
    both within the IFRC and within the collaboration with SOS MEDITERRANEE are feeding
    into the learning process. A Lesson Learnt Workshop involving all stakeholders
    was held on 29 March 2022 to capture the main learnings of this operation. Learnings
    mainly revolved around a strategic approach to tackle humanitarian diplomacy and
    advocacy challenges related to the perceived political sensitivity of the operation,
    securing stable funding and a long-term involvement of the broader IFRC Membership
    to build on the experience and capacities of the network, normalizing the operation
    for a long term modality, ensuring continuity and recurrence of personnel and
    continuing to adapt processes and system requirement to the specific operating
    context.
