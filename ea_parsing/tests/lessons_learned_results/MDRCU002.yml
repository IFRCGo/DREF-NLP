  - "The Sandy operation was one of the largest operations undertaken by the Cuban Red Cross. The fact that came aid from various donors and was mobilized at the same time, resulted in a strenuous effort by the National Society \u2013 mobilizing human and material resources, and implementing an entire system, organizational, operational and logistical. Some of the key lessons learned through the operation were:"
  - "\u2022 Selecting the beneficiaries and defining the aid that would be given to each family was based on a needs analysis. This was very complex due to the logistics, an assessment was carried for the different family situations."
  - "\u2022 For the rooftop kits, a total of 20 sheets per house were initially considered; however, this amount proved to be not enough, since many of the affected homes were too large, and many required at least 60 sheets on average, in this case adjustments had to be made in the original planning."
  - "\u2022 Also, for future operations, it will be necessary to consider zinc sheets in the planning, in order to make the trestles (these are used to close the angle between the roof\u2019s gables)."
  - "\u2022 The National Society designed and implemented a system to receive, register and distribute the goods to the beneficiaries, which was developed and improved during the process, as experience was gained and more agile distribution schemes were found, eventually managing to establish stations for beneficiary registration, item counting and verification, handing over of items, and a logistics area."
  - "\u2022 The government mobilized resources for the delivery of aid, such as: storage, shelter, transportation, fuel and personnel to load and unload items; however, the issue with resources such as transport remains a difficult, since emergencies like Sandy exceed capabilities to make record time in making transport available."
  - "\u2022 Communication tools are another difficult issue, it is necessary to have stock cell phones, as well as and a pre-paid phone plan budgeted to maintain communication between members who lead the operation, especially if they are in the field."
  - "\u2022 It is necessary to also include appropriate protective equipment for volunteers, since handling zinc sheets has its risks. The use of suitable gloves (resistant and of quality) should be prioritized for handling these sheets."
  - "\u2022 Currency and exchange rates vary in this particular context."
  - "\u2022 Special care should be taken to ensure that the loads leave their place of origin with suitable packaging, in order to prevent damage when handling them (storage, loading and unloading)."
  - "\u2022 An assessment of which products to buy and not to buy should be made. For example, based on this experience, collapsible ten liter containers were identified as having a short life-span, so it would be more feasible to invest in other products, such as plastic thermos or buckets, which are made of a stronger materials."
