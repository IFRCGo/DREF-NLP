  - Community engagement and creating ownership within the community is very important to ensure sustainability of developmental gains. The training of the water point committee in community-based management was noted by stakeholders as an important component that would ensure maintenance and sustainability of the water points. Also to note was the importance of having trainings being conducted by local stakeholders rather than ZRCS staff alone. This ensured that communities were aware and develop relationships with the stakeholders for future local efforts. Working with local volunteers for hygiene promotion is also important as this meant that not much recourses would be needed as they are in their local context and this ensures continuity. However, it was also important for the NS to continuously engage the volunteers and improve on volunteer retention even when there is no funding.

  - Cash transfers remain a key tool in empowering communities and individuals to make choices and decisions. Households can decide in terms of the things that they require in their home as compared to direct food distributions which do not give them that freedom of choice. Cash transfers give dignity to the targeted beneficiary as they are not labelled by the community as receivers of aid. By injecting funds into a community, cash transfers program development, help improve local businesses and in some cases, parents are also able to pay school fees for their children.
  - During beneficiary selection, the ZRCS adopted the community participatory process which allowed community members to participate and help in the selection process and thus empowering the community through allowing them to make decisions. The engagement of communities is also key in fostering ownership. Community feedback mechanisms are key in ensuring that we meet the needs of the beneficiaries and these help in improving accountability and learning. In a region that is mainly relying on rain-fed agriculture it is important to promote climate-smart agriculture and adoption of small grains to ensure food security. The lead farmer approach is a key method of helping in the adoption of small grains and other methods of farming.
