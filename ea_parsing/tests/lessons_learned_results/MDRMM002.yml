  - "There has been a considerable amount of lessons learnt and documented from this operation \u2013 the result of a concerted effort among programmes, operations management and support services in the months preceding the closing of the operation, to take a step back and reflect on successes and challenges encountered over the past three years. For the purposes of brevity and external relevance, only the most essential lessons learnt are presented in this report:"
  - "\u2022 The most important learning gained from the Cyclone Nargis operation is that, through good coordination, communication and the focused resourcing of required skills, it is possible to successfully run a large and complex recovery operation within a country context that is filled with various challenges."
  - "\u2022 Key factors which ensured the success of this operation are:"
  - "\u2022 The fact that 77 per cent of funding was secured within the first seven months of the operation, followed by close to 100 per cent of funding by the end of the first year of operations."
  - "\u2022 Restricting the focus of the operation to an \u201Cambitious yet achievable scope\u201D as pointed out in the final evaluation of the operation."
  - "\u2022 The availability of experienced delegates during both the relief and recovery phases."
  - "\u2022 The relatively low turnover of delegates and their National Society counterparts during the recovery phase of the operation. In particular, it should be noted that while management of the operations changed hands three times during the first seven months of the operation, the presence of the fourth head of operations over a 30-month period (January 2009-June 2011), was instrumental in ensuring good direction, momentum and stability for the operation."
  - "\u2022 Positive and productive daily interaction between MRCS and the IFRC country delegation."
  - "\u2022 Having adequate organizational structures and procedures ready is essential for timely and effective emergency response and recovery operations. In this regard, the lack or inadequacy of important organizational structures (e.g. logistics, human resources) and standard operating procedures within MRCS at the outset of the Cyclone Nargis operation, meant that more time was needed to scale up and effectively deliver programmes."
  - "\u2022 The fact that recovery planning began without much delay during the relief phase, facilitated a timely transition from relief to recovery which enabled emerging recovery interventions to be conducted along with outgoing relief activities. However, some locations saw significant gaps between the time of recovery assessments and the launch of activity planning and implementation because of the decision to ) prior to planning and complete all assessments over a large geographical area (about 17,558 sq km implementation \u2013 the learning gained from this is that staggering assessments and recovery action according to geographical and accessibility conditions, can be an option to ensure recovery assistance is initiated as early as possible."
  - "\u2022 A lack of integration of recovery assistance was experienced as a result of the initiation of different sectoral activities according to different timelines as well as the wide operational area which needed to be covered. More efforts should therefore have been made at the outset of recovery planning towards integrating activities for the benefit of affected communities."
  - "\u2022 The transition of a large recovery operation to regular programming needs to begin as early as possible, and consultation with beneficiaries, field offices, volunteers and staff has to be carried out with care and on a continuous basis. These practices were adopted to a large extent in the Nargis operation and helped enormously towards its smooth transition."
  - "\u2022 The hub model which was adopted in the operation and provided for the establishment of new National Society field offices (known as hub offices) to complement existing Red Cross structures, to facilitate the robust implementation required of the large-scale Cyclone Nargis operation, has proven to be appropriate and successful. Appropriate measures to counter friction between Red Cross stalwarts (leaders of township\u2013level volunteer brigades) and \u201Enewcomers\u201F (hub managers), were also adopted early on, and foremost among these was the monthly hub managers meeting in Yangon attended by leaders of both old and new structures, and who provided insightful updates on field successes and challenges. It should also be noted that the hub model in place of IFRC sub-delegations in the field rightfully gave the National Society a stronger sense of ownership of the operation."
  - "\u2022 Providing assistance holistically to communities is likely to have greater impact than wide and sparse delivery to individual households . To a large extent, this holistic targeting was practised in the Cyclone Nargis operation."
  - "\u2022 The meaningful involvement of communities in assessment, planning, beneficiary selections and monitoring has brought about a high sense of ownership, one of the key ingredients of sustainability."
  - "\u2022 MRCS has proven that a National Society is capable of stepping up to immense challenges and in the process, scale up its capacity, if it has the leadership and \u201Eheart\u201F to do so."
