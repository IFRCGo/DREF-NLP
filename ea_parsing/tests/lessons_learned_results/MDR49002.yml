  - "\u2022 The response efforts to Tropical Storm Noel, and subsequently to Tropical Storm Olga, demonstrated the importance of preparedness and pre-positioning of resources and equipment for timely and adequate response."
  - "\u2022 In Haiti, which was severely hit during the hurricane season in 2006, the pre-positioning of resources (response teams and kits) largely helped to reach the most affected people rapidly. It also increased the visibility and positioning of the National Society."
  - "\u2022 In Cuba, the knowledge of the National Society about the country, context and capacities helped to ensure a detailed damage and needs assessment."
  - "\u2022 Thanks to the coordination between the Cuban Red Cross and the International Federation, increased knowledge of Cuban government standards and mechanisms was gained, which has been valuable during other operations carried out on the island. During the hurricane season in 2008, the Red Cross was able to dispatch a \u2018plane to Cuba within the first three days of the onset of the emergency. Hence, response efforts were carried out more rapidly thanks to the previous coordination that took place within this operation."
  - "\u2022 In the Dominican Republic preparedness and risk reduction programmes previously carried out in the country proved particularly valuable. For instance, in the north-east zone of the country a DIPECHO project carried out by the Dominican Red Cross with support from the Spanish Red Cross, increased community preparedness, which was successfully seen during the passage of Tropical Storm Noel as casualties were reduced to a minimum."
  - "\u2022 In the Dominican Republic, the preparation and coordination of the National Society in the area of water and sanitation was significant and assisted in reaching a higher number of beneficiaries than initially planned."
  - "\u2022 Increased integrated response efforts during the emergency phase should be a priority for future operations, encompassing all key areas including health, disaster management, water and sanitation, capacity-building, and other areas."
  - "\u2022 The overall operation strengthened the existing response mechanisms and capacities of each National Society."
  - "Following implementation of the Hurricane No\xEBl response operation, there is a remaining balance of 23,586 Swiss francs. It is proposed to transfer this balance to the 2010-2011 Plan of the Latin Caribbean Regional Representation to support the Cuban Red Cross."
