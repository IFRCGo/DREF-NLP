  items:
  - Despite internal difficulties met by Algerian RC, the emergency operation was successfully handled, showing the impact of the disaster management training component undertaken by the Algerian RC with the support of the International Federation after the Boumerdes earthquake in 2003.
  - Communications with and reporting to the International Federation structures at time of disasters remain a critical issue, despite a real effort from the National Society to set up a daily update. Communications of information is a key issue that needs to be addressed in a proper way through the assignment of a person in the emergency task force.
  - One of the key lessons learned has been the necessity to strengthen the dialogue with the Civil Defence and to work on contingency plans at local, regional or national levels, seeking for complementarity and mutual support.
  - Another interesting lesson from this operation was the capacity of the National Society to mobilise local resources from the public and private sector. Through a good disaster preparedness programme (stocks pre-positioned at regional level) and an effective resource mobilisation plan, the emergency phase can be covered easily by a well prepared National Society. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain funds for the preparedness and organisational phases of operations like the reconstitution and pre-positioning of stocks; risk reduction programmes; and capacity building programmes to invest in local staff and volunteers.
  - Last but not least, bilateral support to Algerian RC from the Gulf National Societies is an important factor of support to the National Society. Sharing of information and the overall coordination concept still remain to be a problematic issue. Transparency from participating National Societies will help to re-assess the in country needs covered or to be covered.
  - The Algerian RC benefits from a solid set up all over the country and confidence of the local population. It is one of the few organizations from the civil society that is highly recognised and which could play an important role at community level, should they be better prepared in advance. This investment and support from the RC/RC Movement and international community is needed, especially when the national authorities are restricting the international assistance. However, it appears that many RC/RC donors are also dependent on government funding and the fact that there was no call for humanitarian assistance from the government was a number of times provided as a reason for National Societies not to be in a position to apply for government funding. This explains partly the low coverage of this Floods Emergency Appeal.
