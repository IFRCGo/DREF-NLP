  - 'A lessons learned activity was carried out on 13 June 2007 to review the emergency response of the national society, with participants that included volunteers, staff, national society management and the International Federation. Key feedback and focus for improvement include the following:'
  - "\u2022 Review the national society\u2019s disaster plan of action and standard operation procedures (SOPs) in light of the experiences of the Gizo branch."
  - "\u2022 The availability of pre-positioned stock was instrumental in ensuring that communities received immediate assistance following the disaster, but the items were limited. The national society plans to explore opportunities to increase its pre-positioned stock level and capacity."
  - "\u2022 In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, coordination between partners and other stakeholders was not strong and will have to be addressed to ensure similar problems do not recur in the future."
  - "\u2022 The national society suggests that a terms of reference (ToR) agreement with the International Federation outlining its role and support during the emergency response stage would have assisted in providing clarification and coordination."
  - "\u2022 Daily briefing and debriefing sessions for volunteers would have been useful."
  - "\u2022 Acknowledgement that local volunteers may also be part of the disaster affected population."
  - Operational and transportation costs remained problematic and expensive throughout the distribution phase. Rented transport between islands was unreliable and inconsistent, resulting in delays that have translated to higher costs and weakened service delivery.
  - Other lessons learned include having too many short-term delegates at the beginning of the operation. This has been addressed through a regional disaster response team (RDRT) training in the region in August 2008, which means that all national societies in the region can ask for specific technical input. All national society disaster management resources have trained together and the regional office encourages the request of specific personnel trained together in RDRT. For now, assessment remains a difficult and expensive undertaking, with the Movement using military assets in recent disaster assessments. The circumstances are unlikely to change given available resources. However, there is an OCHA-led initiative supported by the Federation which helps national disaster management offices train communities to be more prepared as first responders and data collectors.
