The group meets once a quarter.

  - 'The Croatian Red Cross launched the Concept on the Lessons Learned based on the concept and guidelines developed by the Croatian Armed Forces respecting the fundamental principles and conceptual solutions of NATO''s system of lessons learned. The concept describes in detail the process of identifying, analyzing, approving, and applying lessons learned, the responsibilities of individuals and all components of organization in support of a single system of lessons learned, and technical solutions as well as availability of a single database of lessons learned. The aim of drafting the Concept of Lessons Learned (hereinafter: the Concept) is to establish a standardized and harmonized approach to the field of lessons learned in the organization and division of responsibilities in the process of collecting, processing, and publishing lessons learned. The concept describes ways in which the system of lessons learned can best be applied to support leadership and decision-making, and how lessons learned can be applied in correcting perceived shortcomings or finding better solutions in the implementation of tasks. In addition, the Concept describes how to identify and permanently store the best experiences and solutions in operations and other activities and how to inform other team members about such positive experiences.'
