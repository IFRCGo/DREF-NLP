  items:
  - Problems experienced in completing the water and sanitation activities to the planned schedule suggest that there is a need to ensure that work begins on water and sanitation components of relief operations at as early a stage as possible.
  - As a whole, however, the operation was successfully implemented. With the largest number of beneficiaries being those receiving food aid, and this representing the largest portion of the costs of the operation, the successful implementation of this aspect is very significant. The operation delivered over 95 per cent of the planned quantities of maize, the main food commodity, and reached 99 per cent of the targeted number of beneficiaries. As the results of the nutritional survey show, there has been a marked improvement in the levels of malnutrition in the two districts, and whilst there are other factors that influence this, the role of the food distributions in stabilizing the situation is important.
  - Furthermore recovery interventions have been both successfully implemented and shown to be beneficial for the people reached by this facet of the operation. As the monitoring of the crop performance has demonstrated, farmers were able not just to grow as they had before, but in fact enjoyed better yields than in average years, due to the quality of the seed supplied. Whilst it is not possible yet to assess the impact of the sheep distribution, it was felt to be a suitable response, and well implemented. The ERCS will continue to monitor the impact of this intervention in the coming months and years, with a view to repeating it if the results of this monitoring show the expected impact. In general, this operation has emphasized the critical importance of integrating early recovery activities into relief programmes.
