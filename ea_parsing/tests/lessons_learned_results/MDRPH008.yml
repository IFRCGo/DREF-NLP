  items:
  - Throughout the operation, lessons learned during implementation informed adjustments to the implementation plan to ensure that assistance was delivered to beneficiaries effectively.
  - "For instance, in the course of delivering shelter assistance, it was noted that beneficiaries from remote areas expressed that they felt disadvantaged since they had to put in extra resources \u2013 in terms of transportation costs \u2013 compared to those from areas near distribution sites. In future shelter interventions, it may be necessary to allocate a bigger budget for transporting items to accommodate the needs of beneficiaries living in remote areas so as to enhance equity. Such a provision would also position the project teams to ensure that all items needed to repair or to construct have been received by beneficiaries in good condition and on time. This lesson has been applied during the ongoing Typhoon Bopha operation in that for shelter repair kits, an additional amount of up to PHP 2,000 has been set aside for beneficiaries from far-flung areas. The additional amount would cater for transportation of items."
  - "Through maintaining harmonious relations with local authorities in different areas of intervention, PRC \u2013 at national headquarters and chapter levels \u2013 has been able to advocate successfully for safer land to resettle families who used to live in hazard-prone areas. It is important to continue nurturing the relations and engaging the authorities as an auxiliary so as to reach further."
  - Finally, considering the unconditional cash grants provided under this intervention are a first whereby PRC has used the cash transfer methodology, an external evaluation for this project component is planned for July and August 2013. The purpose of the evaluation is to review the impact of cash-based programming (CBP) interventions undertaken by PRC from 2011 as part of emergency appeal operations supported by IFRC, and to analyse key areas for improvement as a whole. The evaluation will specifically look at the design, implementation and sustainability elements of CBP in relief, shelter and livelihoods. It is expected that key lessons and recommendations from the evaluation will guide PRC in future operations and contribute to broader Red Cross Red Crescent learning, particularly to better address needs in emergency, relief and recovery, taking into account long-term impact and sustainability. Once finalized, the report will be shared with interested donors and partners.
