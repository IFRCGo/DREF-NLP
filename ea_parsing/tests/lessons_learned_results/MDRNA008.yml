  - 'In July 2014, a Food Security Assessment was done in Kunene by an external consultant with the following objectives:'
  - "\u2022 To assess the food and nutrition security, livelihoods, coping mechanisms and underlying vulnerabilities of different population groups in Kunene and identify potential risks associated with the failure of the rains;"
  - "\u2022 To support development of a contingency plan and long-term food and nutrition security strategic plan;"
  - "\u2022 To assess the capacity of Namibia Red Cross Society in implementation of the proposed food and nutrition security;"
  - "\u2022 To evaluate previous interventions impact."
  - The conclusions of the study on the impact of the drought operation implemented by Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS) was that while all households in the affected areas received government led food assistance, a comparison of NRCS beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries indicated total incomes, dietary diversity and Coping Strategy Index indicators were relatively better for Namibia Red Cross Society beneficiaries. This is an indication of a positive project outcome by the NRCS intervention. Recommendations formulated by the external assessment team included the need for a continuation of interventions as they were still relevant and appropriate given the food deficits faced by households. However, they found that Namibia Red Cross Society needs to develop a clear strategy on graduation from emergency phase to recovery and development with the overall aim of ensuring resilience among households to the recurring hazard of drought and other common shocks. The national society itself concluded at the end of the operation that there is need to invest in building local staff capacity in disaster response so that they will be able to provide rapid, timely response to emergencies leading to reduced delays associated with recruitment of international staff/delegates.
  - "The national society appreciates the support of both local and international partners and the contributions made to the Emergency Appeal. Contributions were received from the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross (from Canadian Government), Japanese Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross (from Netherlands Red Cross Silent Emergency Fund), Swedish Red Cross, (from Swedish Government), Luxembourg Government, European Commission \u2013 DG ECHO, Red Cross of Monaco, USAID, UNICEF and local businesses."
