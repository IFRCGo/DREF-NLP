  - "Coordination could have been deepened to yield greater results. Agencies such\
    \ as OXFAM and CARE were on the ground together with the ERCS. Coordination did\
    \ take place, for example with ERCS\u2019 participation in the health cluster\
    \ forums and meetings, but this collaboration could have been further strengthened\
    \ in order to provide assistance that was even better targeted. A further lesson\
    \ learned is that it is necessary to plan for greater follow-up and support to\
    \ trained hygiene promoters or PHAST trainers in order to both get a picture of\
    \ the effectiveness of their work, and to help them grow into their role and become\
    \ more effective."
  - There were several causes of delays in the programme, such as the problems mentioned
    above regarding importation of standard AWD kits. Another cause of delays was
    the need to continually redesign programmes to adapt to changing circumstances
    both external (in terms of the reduced needs for WatSan hardware) and internal
    (in terms of, for example, budget revisions due to implementing less capital intensive
    activities), which drew in time in terms of coordination and consultation. These
    delays mean that a balance of funds remains on the project, and this is currently
    being cleared, with expenditures on medical items and support for a clinic in
    West Hararghe, Oromia region and to arrange insurance for 10,000 ERCS volunteers
    such as those who undertook the epidemic prevention campaign. The remainder of
    the balance funds will also support a number of other activities relating to Disaster
    Management and Health and Care that are currently being identified by the ERCS.
