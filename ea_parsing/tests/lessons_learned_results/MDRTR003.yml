  - In terms of sustainability, livelihoods interventions were considered very helpful where beneficiaries could set up their own businesses or initiatives, but less so for securing employment or work opportunities, or teaching new skills. Financial support would be helpful to set up a business in order to capitalize on training received. The number of targeted beneficiaries can be reduced to enhance the quality of livelihoods services. This would allow the budget allocation per beneficiary to be higher, and to expand the range of services for individual beneficiaries. Lastly in terms of monitoring, processes should be amended to capture the number of activities and participants in online activities, which gained momentum with the COVID-19 outbreak.

  - The protection component, mainly funded by DG ECHO, was a highly (perhaps overly) ambitious project, considering TRCS was being a sole implementer of a full-blown protection programme. Greater coordination and information sharing between partners; more clarity regarding roles, responsibilities and guidance for field staff; and better adherence to planned timelines on the part of both donor and implementers are among the factors that could have contributed towards achievement of the original targets. As such, the need for modification requests and return of funds may have been avoided. All said, this project has achieved some success in helping a fair number (111%) of its original target population. Other than that, it was a highly successful learning experience, which will hold TRCS in good stead for similar projects in the future.
  - In terms of gender, both the EUTF MADAD baseline and endline showed that women were more likely to attend the community centres and avail of the services provided. Although working hours were a barrier, the main barrier was more around the cultural perception that such activities were more appropriate for women.
