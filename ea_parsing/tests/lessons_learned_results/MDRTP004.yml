  - Following the assessment, the drought plan of action was revised on 15 September
    2016 to increase the number of target households from 4,000 to 5,500. Of this,
    2,700 households were identified as requiring support to enhance their food security
    and strengthen their livelihoods. The revision also combined the existing health
    and nutrition activities to be under a single outcome. This revised strategy was
    designed specifically to support and prepare communities for the lean season due
    in Timor-Leste, from November to March.
  - In order to support affected communities under this revision, a tender for food
    purchase was issued, however, the tender did not receive an adequate response
    and as a result, CVTL elected to broaden its planned cash transfer programme (CTP)
    to include money for local food procurement. This decision was backed by findings
    from data collected during a seasonal mapping, livelihoods assessment and community
    consultation. An updated Plan of Action was developed initially for food, seed
    and conditional cash transfer activities, and was later replaced by a broader
    unconditional cash transfer programme. After a revalidation of household data,
    2,543 heads of households (1,678 males and 865 females) received unconditional
    cash of USD 50 between November and December 2016. The development of CTP procedures,
    training and proposed sensitization of community committees has also been undertaken
    with the support of a peer advisor from the Philippines Red Cross.
  - Post-distribution monitoring (PDM) survey was designed to measure the beneficiary
    satisfaction of non-food items and cash grants distributed during the operation
    and the current recovery status of assisted households were conducted between
    March and May in one affected community in each of the three municipalities.
  - "The unconditional cash grant was very well received, with 76% of the PDM respondents\
    \ and all focus group participants targeted in the final evaluation said they\
    \ spent the cash on food, which was the intended result. Cash beneficiaries also\
    \ reported a high level of satisfaction with cash transfer as a modality of assistance\
    \ (82% of men and 71% of women) compared with the distribution of non-food Items.\
    \ As this was the first time CVTL implemented a Cash Transfer Programme, they\
    \ also CVTL staff registers a community member for experienced challenges related\
    \ to the complex and time consuming beneficiary selection process, calculation\
    \ of the amount of assistance and handling and recording the complaints. As per\
    \ the final evaluation, the CVTL staff interviewed had a positive impression of\
    \ cash programming originating from \u201Clearning by doing\u201D which dispelled\
    \ misconceptions. Staff also benefited from IFRC technical support not only in\
    \ being trained in CTP prior to implementation but through assistance in drafting\
    \ CTP SOPs after the intervention."

  - Although some delays were caused by accessibility, such as in certain parts of
    Viqueque district where communities are geographically dispersed and are only
    accessible by foot, most of the activities was successfully completed. The distribution
    of hygiene kits reached in total 4,546 households.
  - Some 2,612 people affected by drought in eight communities in Viqueque, 1,777
    people in four communities in Bacau and 2,645 people in one community in Lautem
    (7,034 people in total) have received hygiene promotion and awareness messaging
    via door to door visits and distribution of posters. This messaging includes safe
    water management and handwashing as well as prevention of malaria and dengue.
    It was originally planned that this education would be accompanied by the distribution
    of hygiene kits to families. However, this was delayed due to procurement and
    finally took place in November. CVTL volunteers conduct hygiene promotion
  - Monitoring of hygiene practices in target communities was planned to be carried
    out via post-distribution monitoring visits. While the monitoring visits were
    undertaken, the visits were not recorded sufficiently to verify how well the practices
    have been adopted to all targeted communities. CVTL are determined to improve
    monitoring tools and process for future operations.

  items:
  - The extension of operation timeframe was largely sought due to delays in implementing
    some activities under this sector due to gaps in technical support available from
    IFRC for CVTL.
  - 'During the operation, eight full time staff were recruited by CVTL to support
    the branch and headquarters staff to implement the drought plan of action. Five
    staff members were recruited at the national level and three at branch level (one
    for each district: Lautem, Viqueque and Baucau).'
  - CVTL convened regular drought task force meetings, where a representative from
    each of CVTL departments came together to strategize and plan this drought response.
    The final evaluation highlighted the establishment of the task force as an important
    initiative enabling senior management to take a more direct role in ensuring tasks
    and functions were resourced adequately to ease the workload of the Disaster Management
    Unit. This task force structure is now formalized into CVTL Standard Operating
    Procedures for emergency response, that were revised and finalized after the final
    evaluation and based on the drought response, with the support of the DRM Delegate
    from CCST Jakarta.
  - Non-food relief items including kitchen sets, blankets, water containers, hygiene
    kits and tarpaulins for 400 families in each of the three districts were requisitioned
    from the Asia Pacific Regional Logistics Unit and arrived in Dili in early 2017.
    This stock will be managed by the respective branches and prepositioned for future
    shocks including the pending lean and wet seasons.
  - National Disaster Response Team went through Emergency WatSan refresher training
    in March 2017 in Dili and Branch Disaster Response Team refresher trainings were
    carried out in all three affected branches.
  - British Red Cross are currently supporting CVTL in logistics capacity development.
    The pre-positioned initiative with training and development support and logistics
    SOP development has been linked and harmonised with the logistics development
    plan of action. Warehousing assessments, inventory and branch capacity have been
    undertaken in the branches in Viqueque, Bacau and Lautem with the support of British
    Red Cross. Since the assessments found issues related to branch storage actually
    go beyond the operation scope, part of the preparedness stock is prepositioned
    in Dili warehouse.
  - The National Society was also considering to undertake the revised Well Prepared
    National Society (WPNS+) self- assessment as a step towards an evidence-based
    approach to enhancing its disaster response capacity. As technical guidance for
    this process were not available during the operation timeframe, CVTL will carry
    this exercise out with peer support later on in 2017. CVTL has contingency plans
    for flood, drought and election preparedness. The experience gained from implementing
    this operation provides a good opportunity to review the drought contingency plan,
    this will be carried out after the WPNS+ exercise.
  - "The final evaluation notes that CVTL\u2019s capacity to respond to disasters\
    \ has been enhanced, most noticeably in regard to cash programming. Prior to the\
    \ operation, there was a reluctance to consider cash programming, particularly\
    \ amongst senior management. All CVTL staff interviewed now had a positive impression\
    \ of cash programming. There was no doubt from \u201Clearning by doing\u201D which\
    \ dispelled misconceptions, but staff also benefited from IFRC technical support\
    \ not only in being trained in CTP prior to implementation but through assistance\
    \ in drafting CTP SOPs after the intervention."
  - "A number of technical trainings and capacity building activities were undertaken\
    \ and delivered during this operation, however what is most noticeable is the\
    \ \u2018accompaniment\u2019 approach of the IFRC operations managers. The evaluation\
    \ noted considerable capacity improvement in the staff and CVTL; indicating the\
    \ positive impact of staff and organizational capacity development prior to and\
    \ part of this emergency response."

  - "CVTL regularly respond to meteorological hazards including floods and landslips\
    \ during the annual rainy season. Forecasters predict a 50% chance of a developing\
    \ La Ni\xF1a conditions in 2017, which potentially can result in increased rainfall\
    \ and floods. Therefore, CVTL kept a database on rainfall until the rainy season\
    \ started in January/February and ends in May. The rainfall patterns in January-March\
    \ were very erratic, returning to normality in some drought-affected areas but\
    \ not in all."
  - "CVTL have a draft contingency plan for flood response, a contingency plan for\
    \ drought and a contingency plan for election preparedness. The DRM Delegate has\
    \ undertaken a desk based review of all of the contingency plans and has worked\
    \ with CVTL to do a country specific risk and hazard mapping. Due to resource\
    \ constraints, there was insufficient time within the operation to revise all\
    \ of CVTL\u2019s contingency plans. Based on discussions with CVTL, it was agreed\
    \ that a review of the current Standard Operation Procedures was the main priority,\
    \ which was done in a workshop in June 2017. The review of contingency plans would\
    \ be done once the WPNS+ review was undertaken, in the second half of 2017."
  - Communities receiving assistance under the cash distribution plan also received
    awareness information and guidance on seasonal risk reduction via the community
    recovery committees and broadcasts on local radio. Radio messaging targeted 20
    communities in Baucau (8), Lautem (5) and Viqueque (7) reaching the total population
    of 28,650 people. Participatory risk mapping was done with community members and
    local authorities in three communities, after which the risk maps with prevention
    messaging (posters) were put in government building for public display. CVTL also
    increased Disaster Risk Reduction messaging using social media identified as a
    gap in CVTL drought task force meetings. Besides the disaster risk messaging,
    no additional seasonal forecasts were transmitted to the communities during the
    operation.
  - The Joint Rapid Assessment process has however kicked-off the discussion on the
    need for national Early Warning Early Action system not targeting only high winds,
    rains and floods recurrent in the country but also drought. Within this framework,
    FAO is supporting the Timor-Leste Ministry of Agriculture to create a seasonal
    forecast system for agricultural and drought monitoring purposes. CVTL has offered
    assistance in supporting the dissemination of weather forecast messaging through
    its volunteers once the system is in place. At the moment, CVTL plans to assist
    its Ministry of Interior with disseminating weather warnings through its branch
    volunteer network.
  - "Integrated Community-Based Risk Reduction (ICBRR) programme is CVTL\u2019s biggest\
    \ long-term resilience programme supported by a Consortium of Red Cross partners\
    \ formed by Australian, British, Korean and New Zealand Red Cross societies together\
    \ with KOICA and IFRC. ICBRR works on community resilience in improving access\
    \ to water and promoting livelihoods. The first and foremost recommendation in\
    \ the Joint Rapid Assessment on the Delayed Impact of El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation\
    \ in Timor-Leste was to support most affected communities through resilience building\
    \ programmes so as to effectively help affected households to recover. The community\
    \ vulnerability to drought will be taken into account by CVTL as an important\
    \ criterion in the next ICBRR community selection round."

  items:
  - Assessments 23 National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) and 90 Branch Response Team
    (BDRT) members received training and refreshers on assessment methods prior to
    conducting door to door household assessments in the twenty targeted communities
    in May. The resulting data collected identified the 5,500 households that will
    benefit from this operation as well as the 2,700 households identified as being
    candidates for the CTP. Prior to the commencement of the CTP in October, each
    community had its data revalidated by a fresh assessment and analysis. A pilot
    livelihoods assessment and seasonal mapping took place in two villages in Lautem
    in September 2016. Its purpose was to establish a more recent baseline and seasonal
    calendar to inform livelihood options. This initiative resulted in the confirmation
    and establishment of cash transfer programme as the primary livelihood and nutrition
    activity.
  - Community engagement and accountability Community engagement has been refocused
    with the establishment of community recovery committees to support the implementation
    of CTP and to disseminate information to affected communities. These groups are
    representative of communities and include the vulnerable, women and established
    leadership. Each committee is also responsible for the revalidation of beneficiary
    data and engagement with branch volunteers and staff for the distribution of cash.
    A complaint hotline has been activated at the CVTL headquarters data on the outcomes
    of any calls was not available but will be analysed to inform programming in real
    time.
  - "Monitoring Informal recording of activities by CVTL staff and volunteers is ongoing.\
    \ This will require continued strengthening to meet more formal reporting requirements\
    \ but also to establish evidence based indicators of change and impact over the\
    \ longer term. This is viewed as important by CVTL especially in relation to hygiene\
    \ promotion and cash transfer activities. A monitoring template has been established\
    \ to accompany the revised plan of action. A peer from Indonesian Red Cross (PMI)\
    \ has recently conducted a PMER capacity assessment with support from the British\
    \ Red Cross and will be used to guide future development. The final evaluation\
    \ also noted the same need to strengthen CVTL\u2019s capacities in data collection\
    \ and analysis, evident in the slow Post-Distribution Monitoring survey process.\
    \ The Post Distribution Monitoring fell short of the planned 10% of the recipients\
    \ receiving cash in envelope, reaching only 5.9% recipients (150 households out\
    \ of 2,543 households was involved in the survey)."
  - Gender and diversity Gendered impacts of drought were built into the in different
    phases of the operation. Female-headed households, pregnant and nursing mothers
    and families with small children were targeted with different strategies under
    the operation. Disability inclusion was considered during the beneficiary selection
    and the accessibility of cash distribution points to disabled beneficiaries was
    properly ensured.  All beneficiary monitoring data recorded by the CVTL Disaster
    Management Unit was disaggregated by sex but not by age groups. The operation
    did not however meet the IFRC commitment of demonstrate evidence of addressing
    sexual and gender-based violence or child protection. The final evaluation noted
    that only 20% of men reported problems with the cash received as part the operation
    compared to 33% of women but as the type of problem faced was not recorded, the
    evaluation suggests further investigation to be made prior to future CTPs.
  - Evaluation and learning Participatory workshops on sharing experiences and identifying
    strengths and weaknesses in the operation were held in three affected branches
    in April 2017. Lessons learned were translated and used as material in the final
    evaluation carried out in May 2017. The key recommendations of the evaluations
    were dealt with CVTL through management response mechanism. One of the main recommendations
    is, to review the current emergency Standard Operation Procedures based on the
    lessons learned from the operation and new good practices were created.
