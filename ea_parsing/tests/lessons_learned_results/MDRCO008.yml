  - "Given the extent of the emergency and the scope of the National Society\u2019s overall plan of action, the operation provided a well of experiences to analyze and gain from. The following lessons learned were gathered by all relief directors at the branch level involved in the operation, as well as members of the CRCS\u2019s headquarters and supporting personnel from the IFRC:"
  - "\u2022 As the affectation was extended across the country with several branches completing similar responses, it became evident that the effectiveness and efficiency of the operation could be improved in similar operations through more networking and cooperation among involved branches. In addition, the National Society acknowledges the need to better systematize the gathering of information in order to ensure that comparison of information between branches are possible, as well as to ensure that gender and age information is available for decision-making."
  - "\u2022 The support of the IFRC\u2019s Regional Logistic Unit during the local procurement of relief items and equipment for the National Society was essential in having an organized process. Yet, in order to initiate the process in a swift manner, it should be analyzed the possibility of increasing available funds during the first days of the response."
  - "\u2022 The institutional image of the National Society was strengthened with the Local Committees for Disaster Prevention and Relief (CLOPAD) of the municipalities reached. In addition, the actions of the CRCS were covered by several national media outlets."
  - "\u2022 The need to further improve the systematization of beneficiaries reached by providing codes for municipalities and departments. This will become particularly useful for organizing relief activities in risk-prone areas where natural disasters may occur frequently. Furthermore, the National Society decided to put more efforts into standardizing the process of relief distribution, whilst allowing for adaptation based on the regional and local context."
  - "\u2022 The importance of pre-positioning stock in strategically located warehouses across the country. Particularly as the damages in infrastructures during event of this scale drastically increases the time for transportation. The CRCS is analysing the possibility of increasing this capacity through strategic alliances with particular providers."
  - "\u2022 As the time of response increased with new events developing throughout the year, the rollout of personnel and volunteers to avoid exhaustion was of essence. The National Society will be updating their databases on trained volunteers and will be reviewing their training modules to ensure more persons are ready to respond."
  - "\u2022 Providing psychosocial support to the affected communities was an added value to provide a comprehensive health support."
