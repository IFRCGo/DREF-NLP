  items:
  - ': Over 60,000 people were assisted either through direct relief distributions, psychosocial support or repair of the damaged homes. This proved that the Red Cross has the network to deliver and is a trusted auxiliary to the government at times of national disaster.'
  - The operation had many highlights. It offered an opportunity to both National Societies to improve their procurement, finance and fleet management practices as a result of an additional training provided by the Federation staff based in the country during the operation. The outbreak of water-borne diseases has been averted. Immediate emergency needs of the affected populations were covered. People had sufficient food, safe water, psychosocial support and their homes damaged by the floods were made habitable again.
  - "During the operation, cooperation at all levels was good. The government authorities acted swiftly and where capacities allowed provided support to the Red Cross teams as well. The immediate allocations from DREF enabled both National Societies to move ahead without a delay with their plans \u2013 within minutes of the DREF being announced Ukraine Red Cross had ordered the first of 10,000 membrane water filters."
  - Another lesson learned was the high reputation the Red Cross brand enjoys locally and overseas. The disaster generated many donations to the appeal and directly to the National Societies. Various countries, international organizations, NGOs and private companies (including multinationals like McDonalds, Nestle, Digital and Citibank) contributed to the disaster response efforts.
  - Contributions arrived through the International Federation and bilaterally from partner National Societies. Donations were received from the American, Canadian, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Lithuanian and Polish Red Cross Societies as well as from the Red Cross Societies of Luxemburg, Monaco and Netherlands.
  - The Hungarian Red Cross sent canned goods, bed-linen, blankets, clothes and furniture of the total value of 30,000 US dollars for the flood affected residents of Rahovsky and Hustsky districts in Zakarpattya region of Ukraine. The German Red Cross provided in-kind donation of medicine, bedding and washing supplies for distribution in Ivano-Frankivska region. The US embassy in Ukraine was coordinating support from the American private companies. One of the first to respond to the call for support were the 3M, Day Europe, Kimberly Clark and Tetra Park companies, who contributed with hygiene items, milk and drinking water.
  - "The Chernivets\u2019ka regional branch of the Ukraine Red Cross received blankets, water tanks and water treatment products of UAH 110,000 (about 20,000 US dollars), as in-kind contribution from USAID. The Italian Red Cross donated 100,000 euros to the response in Moldova. In early August, the Moldova Red Cross received in-kind donation of food parcels, blankets, mattresses, water tanks and soap of the total value of 1,462,711 lei (equivalent to 150,790 US dollars) from the Turkish Red Crescent Society for distribution to the flood affected population. The French embassy in Moldova contributed 30,000 euros."
  - "The media coverage of the Red Cross operations in both countries was excellent, and both National Societies communicated regularly with the public to share the latest update from the disaster affected regions. A number of articles about the Red Cross\u2019s work were published in local and national newspapers as well both in Ukraine and Moldova. At the height of the disaster, when the Federation\u2019s country representative and assessment team were travelling in the heaviest affected areas, it was observed that national news was devoting the first 15 minutes of the evening news to the disaster, with the Red Cross response playing a lead role."
