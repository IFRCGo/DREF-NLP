  - Given the limited funding received, only 7% of the identified needs were able
    to be covered through the operation; therefore with the support of the IFRC, developed
    an advocacy campaign  at local level in collaboration with UN agencies (UNICEF,
    UNDP, WFP). This campaign  at the local level contributed to the achievement of
    results in the shelter sector which were unmet by the EA; but able to be addressed
    in cooperation with other organizations.. This suggests that CoRC should explore
    the potential for strengthening local partnership and opportunities for resource
    mobilisation at the country level, especially in advance of another disaster situation.
  - Another lesson learned is the advantage of community participation. In localities
    where the CoRC has established 77 community management committees, it did not
    encounter any difficulties in targeting within the affected population (identifying
    the recipients) or implementation of the activities planned (relief distributions).
    However, in localities where community management committees had not been established,
    targeting, selection and planning and implemention was more challenging, resulting
    in delays in reaching the affected population with necessary assistance.
