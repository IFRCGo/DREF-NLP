  items:
  - Given the limited funding received, only 7% of the identified needs were able to be covered through the operation; therefore with the support of the IFRC, developed an advocacy campaign at local level in collaboration with UN agencies (UNICEF, UNDP, WFP). This campaign at the local level contributed to the achievement of results in the shelter sector which were unmet by the EA; but able to be addressed in cooperation with other organizations.. This suggests that CoRC should explore the potential for strengthening local partnership and opportunities for resource mobilisation at the country level, especially in advance of another disaster situation.
  - Another lesson learned is the advantage of community participation. In localities where the CoRC has established 77 community management committees, it did not encounter any difficulties in targeting within the affected population (identifying the recipients) or implementation of the activities planned (relief distributions). However, in localities where community management committees had not been established, targeting, selection and planning and implemention was more challenging, resulting in delays in reaching the affected population with necessary assistance.
