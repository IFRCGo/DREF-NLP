  - "\u2022 Appropriate Selection Criteria: The evaluation team (ET) found that the criteria for selecting the target population were appropriate and relevant to the needs of the affected population. It is recommended that similar criteria be used in future operations. However, it was noted that the selection criteria restricted the inclusion of landless vulnerable populations in receiving support from recovery operations, especially for shelter. Some affected populations, with similar or worse vulnerability compared to the target population of this flood operation, could not benefit solely based on these criteria. While these criteria were essential to ensure the appropriate use of shelter and WASH support, alternative support mechanisms may be considered for these vulnerable populations."
  - "\u2022 Community Participation and Owner-Driven Approach: Community participation and an owner-driven approach to shelter reconstruction were highly appreciated by community members. The targeted households expressed satisfaction with the quality of CGI sheets and recommended providing similar in- kind and conditional cash assistance along with technical guidance in future operations."

  - "\u2022 Currently, BDRCS has established a framework agreement with financial service providers, notably the Bangladesh Post Office, to facilitate cash assistance through mobile money transfer services. This arrangement has enabled BDRCS to reach affected individuals across the country, even in remote locations. Working in coordination with the financial service provider, BDRCS has set up distribution centers at convenient locations for the targeted households. However, BDRCS does not yet have a framework agreement with suppliers for the delivery of food items. To enhance its response capabilities and reach affected people in a timely manner, BDRCS is planning to establish long-term framework agreements with suppliers for essential relief items."
  - "\u2022 Market assessments have proven to be instrumental in helping BDRCS make informed decisions regarding various cash-based interventions. It is recommended that similar market assessments be conducted in future operations. Furthermore, providing training to volunteers and staff in this regard will be beneficial."

  - "\u2022 Strong coordination with government agencies, local administration, and other humanitarian organizations is essential for identifying the most vulnerable geographical areas and demographics. This collaborative approach ensures effective intervention by the RCRC (Red Cross Red Crescent) movement."
  - "\u2022 The use of real-time ICT-based data significantly enhances the pace (speed and accuracy) of beneficiary selection analysis. BDRCS employed mobile-based applications like KoboCollect for conducting household assessments, and a dedicated Information Management (IM) team supported the necessary data analysis. This streamlined approach ultimately aided BDRCS in completing beneficiary selection in a timely manner."
  - "\u2022 The final evaluation highlighted the security and effectiveness of cash distribution through the BPO, especially during disasters. This preference is attributed to the broader network of the BPO and its mobile phone-based verification technique, which ensures a reliable mode of cash distribution."

  - "\u2022 Due to the flood's impact on water sources, BDRCS initiated a tube well repair and disinfection programme for target households. Despite requesting local branches to procure new tube wells, a lack of contractor interest hindered progress. To expedite installation, BDRCS engaged local communities in a participatory approach. They formed small groups in need of safe drinking water, receiving cash assistance and technical guidance. This resulted in 13 new tube wells in flood-affected areas, a successful approach to be replicated in future operations."

  - "\u2022 According to the evaluation, PWDs found the assistive devices highly beneficial for their mobility. These assistive devices enable them to carry out daily activities and participate actively in community life."
  - "\u2022 To provide appropriate support to PWDs, BDRCS need to maintain strong collaboration and coordination with specialized service providers or organizations. This will allow the specialized organizations/service providers to share their expertise, knowledge, strategies, methods, and technologies in providing long- term solution and ensure sustainability. It is also recommended to have formal MoU or agreement with such specialized organizations or service providers to reach the targeted person timely and efficiently."

  - Particularly BDRCS branches in Sylhet region, there is no dedicated localized fund available to carry out anticipatory actions. Based on lessons learned, it is recommended to consider these branches for allocating dedicated fund similar like cyclone prone BDRCS branches, which will allow local BDRCS branch to take necessary anticipatory actions on time.
  - Due to low funding coverage, BDRCS was not able run the tree plantation campaign widely. It is recommended to include similar green response activities more widely through reaching more people.
