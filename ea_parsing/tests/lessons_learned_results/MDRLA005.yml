  - This EA operation has yielded several important lessons in working together which are applicable to all aspects of the operational plan. One of the key lessons is that, in future operations, IFRC needs to work with LRC on needs assessments early on and that, training and capacity building of LRC (on areas detailed below) is essential for LRC to deal with large recovery operations in future. IFRC is including this in its operational plan going forward.
  - Some aspects of project implementation, especially cash-based interventions were new for the LRC, and it took additional time and effort to understand and implement by the team. LRC has gained a lot of valuable experience from this operation. Further support from IFRC in development of disaster response and recovery SOPS and training for staff and volunteers will help them to be better prepared to manage such disasters in future.
  - Lack of trained volunteers also hampered the operation. Implementation of all activities like beneficiary verification, assessment, distribution, and monitoring was done by Red Cross staff, which in fact, could have been done by volunteers. Hence, creation of a trained pool of volunteers is needed.
  - Having gained experience of a large recovery operation, moving forward LRC should develop further SOPs and conduct training at HQ and chapter level to be prepared for all eventualities. SOPs and training should focus on the entire process from conducting needs assessments, community engagement, planning and preparation of activities through to implementation and monitoring. The LRC team would also benefit from trainings on templates for reporting, assessments, and monitoring, helping the team to embed practices into all projects as well as disaster response and recovery operations. As a part of the process of continual improvement LRC should engage with IFRC to implement Preparedness for Effective Response (PER).
  - IFRC will provide procurement and logistics training and capacity building support to the LRC, to better carry out significant procurement of materials. IFRC and LRC have identified the technical support needed when it comes to such large operations in Laos, to complement LRC staff and capacity and IFRC is including this in its operational plan going forward.

  - There is a requirement for LRC to have more trained personnel and volunteers that can be deployed to support a disaster response or recovery operation, rather than relying on ad-hoc community based volunteers with little or no training or experience.
  - Further work is required to edit and adapt the health training packages and promotion guidelines to the Laos context and capacities of staff and volunteers. The LRC health team also needs to set participant criteria for health and first- aid trainings based on experience and existing capacity.
  - After trainings there is a need for HQ and chapters to monitor and conduct refresher training of staff and volunteers on an annual basis. In addition, the First Aid kits provided to volunteers, communities and schools needs to be checked every three to six months to ensure they are properly stocked and useable.
