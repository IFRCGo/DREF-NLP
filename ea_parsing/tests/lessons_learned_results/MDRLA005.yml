  - This EA operation has yielded several important lessons in working together which
    are applicable to all aspects of the operational plan. One of the key lessons
    is that, in future operations, IFRC needs to work with LRC on needs assessments
    early on and that, training and capacity building of LRC (on areas detailed below)
    is essential for LRC to deal with large recovery operations in future. IFRC is
    including this in its operational plan going forward.
  - Some aspects of project implementation, especially cash-based interventions were
    new for the LRC, and it took additional time and effort to understand and implement
    by the team. LRC has gained a lot of valuable experience from this operation.
    Further support from IFRC in development of disaster response and recovery SOPS
    and training for staff and volunteers will help them to be better prepared to
    manage such disasters in future.
  - Lack of trained volunteers also hampered the operation. Implementation of all
    activities like beneficiary verification, assessment, distribution, and monitoring
    was done by Red Cross staff, which in fact, could have been done by volunteers.
    Hence, creation of a trained pool of volunteers is needed.
  - Having gained experience of a large recovery operation, moving forward LRC should
    develop further SOPs and conduct training at HQ and chapter level to be prepared
    for all eventualities. SOPs and training should focus on the entire process from
    conducting needs assessments, community engagement, planning and preparation of
    activities through to implementation and monitoring. The LRC team would also benefit
    from trainings on templates for reporting, assessments, and monitoring, helping
    the team to embed practices into all projects as well as disaster response and
    recovery operations. As a part of the process of continual improvement LRC should
    engage with IFRC to implement Preparedness for Effective Response (PER).
  - IFRC will provide procurement and logistics training and capacity building support
    to the LRC, to better carry out significant procurement of materials. IFRC and
    LRC have identified the technical support needed when it comes to such large operations
    in Laos, to complement LRC staff and capacity and IFRC is including this in its
    operational plan going forward.

  - There is a requirement for LRC to have more trained personnel and volunteers that
    can be deployed to support a disaster response or recovery operation, rather than
    relying on ad-hoc community based volunteers with little or no training or experience.
  - Further work is required to edit and adapt the health training packages and promotion
    guidelines to the Laos context and capacities of staff and volunteers. The LRC
    health team also needs to set participant criteria for health and first- aid trainings
    based on experience and existing capacity.
  - After trainings there is a need for HQ and chapters to monitor and conduct refresher
    training of staff and volunteers on an annual basis. In addition, the First Aid
    kits provided to volunteers, communities and schools needs to be checked every
    three to six months to ensure they are properly stocked and useable.

  - As PGI and SGBV are technical areas in which it is possible to create further
    harm in communities, it is important to have adequately trained staff and volunteers.
    This makes having a proficient translator during community events and trainings
    necessary, and PGI should be prioritized in this regard.
  - Early inclusion of PGI staff and focal points in the planning periods are necessary
    for sufficient mainstreaming. This was done in the early planning period with
    LRC, but it was more of a coincidence than a planned event.
  - A situation where additional trained staff could be allocated to support the PGI
    work would be required in future disaster response work with LRC in order to ensure
    better overall program quality and to ensure that there are less disruptions in
    planned activities.
