  items:
  - The response to the cholera epidemic showed that volunteers can be an important component of cholera eradication if adequate training and material are provided to them. The prepositioning of cholera NFIs in key cholera-prone areas is also a major issue to be tackled to provide for a rapid assistance to beneficiaries (Chad is a landlocked country and importation from neighboring countries causes unacceptable delays). Advocacy at NS level should also focus on contingency funding in support of running costs, such as the payment of volunteers and transportation costs.
