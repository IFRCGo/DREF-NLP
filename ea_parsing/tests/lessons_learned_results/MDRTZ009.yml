  - Having disaster preparedness stocks and trained volunteers is a starting point
    to timely response. The National Society volunteers were on ground just 30 minutes
    after bomb blasts, and immediately initiated response activities. It is therefore
    paramount for the National Society to maintain a minimum and reasonable number
    of basic non-food items (NFIs) in its disaster preparedness stocks and trained
    disaster response teams.
