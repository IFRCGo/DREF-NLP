  - Having disaster preparedness stocks and trained volunteers is a starting point to timely response. The National Society volunteers were on ground just 30 minutes after bomb blasts, and immediately initiated response activities. It is therefore paramount for the National Society to maintain a minimum and reasonable number of basic non-food items (NFIs) in its disaster preparedness stocks and trained disaster response teams.
