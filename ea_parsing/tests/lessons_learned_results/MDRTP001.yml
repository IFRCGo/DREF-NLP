  - 'A two-day review meeting of the storms and floods operation was organized by CVTL in cooperation with Federation on 29-30 January 2007. Participants from five districts, as well as disaster management, health, logistic and finance departments at headquarters attend the meeting and discussed mainly on the following aspects:'
  - "\u2022 What achievements were made,"
  - "\u2022 What was done well,"
  - "\u2022 What problems and difficulties were encountered and"
  - "\u2022 What can be done better for the future."
  - 'The meeting revisited the past and made some recommendations for improvements for the future programmes as follows:'
  - "\u2022 Limited staff members and capacity of the available staff and volunteers were the main bottleneck in delivering services. Poor road condition and bad weather made delivering materials to the community very difficult and also limited the CVTL\u2019s service to the community. Therefore, it is important to develop contingency plans at the beginning so that the over all operation would not be affected."
  - "\u2022 Lack of transportation support and poor communication means with the communities and the national headquarters affected the operation."
  - "\u2022 Project was not implemented in line with the original plan because of security problems and the continuous wet weather in the mountains."
  - "\u2022 Community\u2019s involvement throughout the whole process \u2013 from operation planning through implementation and monitoring \u2013 needs to improve."
  - 'Recommendations:'
  - "\u2022 Training and support needed to increase staff and volunteers\u2019 skill and knowledge about project management and implementation. Moreover, it is important to increase overall organizational capacity to manage emergency operations."
  - "\u2022 Improved communication with government, community and stakeholders is important. This could be facilitated through a better coordination mechanism."
  - "\u2022 Improvements in the framework for working with communities required. There is a need to work together with communities and develop community-based approaches to increase their participation in emergency operations."
  - "\u2022 Improvements in transportation and communication to support the community needed."
  - "\u2022 Radio communication and the volunteer networks need to be strengthened for this purpose."
  - "\u2022 Activities need to be carried out according to the plan."
  - "\u2022 Operation schedule to be developed in consultation with districts as well."
  - "\u2022 Regular monitoring, reporting and evaluation should be in place."
  - "\u2022 Evaluation should be done by a third party to avoid biases."
