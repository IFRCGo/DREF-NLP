  - The response to the 2008 hurricane season was the largest emergency response operation conducted by the National Society in the last 15 years, and as such has had a notable impact on the institution, strengthening existing processes and highlighting capacity-building areas for future emergency response operations.
  - "\u2022 Emergency relief: The quick response of and close coordination between the National Society and the Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) following the impact of the hurricane ensured that a coherent Plan of Action was drawn up that responded to the immediate needs of the affected population. In particular, the use of prepositioned relief items in warehouses in the region and their quick deployment to the country made it possible for the Red Cross to provide immediate relief to beneficiaries. However, the fluctuation of the prices of some relief items indicates that it may be necessary to conduct a study of the market and existing agreements with suppliers in the region, in particular for those products for which there is the greatest demand."
  - "\u2022 Institutional strengthening: The operation has served to strengthen links between the Cuban Red Cross\u2019 national headquarters and the provincial and municipal branches, not only improving internal relations but also transferring capacity in the technical and operational roles of emergency management."
  - "\u2022 Development and integration of broader, longer-term recovery strategies: The inclusion of an early recovery component in the CRC plan of action has provided much needed, valuable longer- term support to the affected communities in their recovery from the aftermath of the hurricanes. At the same time it is promoting and developing new skill sets within the Cuban Red Cross regional branches which will be key in providing integral response."
  - "\u2022 Recruitment, training and promotion of volunteers: In total, 139 new volunteers were recruited from the affected communities, with local populations keen to support the work of the Red Cross in the development of the operation. The response also afforded the opportunity to provide training to volunteers at the local level, including specialized training in disaster response and preparedness."
  - "\u2022 Strengthening of inter-institutional links: Close coordination with all actors involved in the response was required, improving relations with national and local authorities and non- governmental organizations, as well as with members of the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement. This served to consolidate existing and new partnerships vital to respond not only to this but to future emergencies."
  - "\u2022 Strengthening of community links: By its very nature, an operation such as this serves to strengthen links with affected communities, not only in the immediate response but in the early recovery and recovery phases, enhancing a greater understanding of community needs and establishing priorities for continued action in these areas. Actions developed under the operation have served to strengthen links with formal and informal community leaders, as well as in the recruitment of community volunteers."
  - Although the operation has officially ended, the CRC continues its work in responding to community needs and in addressing broader disaster risk reduction issues.
  - "On behalf of Cuban Red Cross, the International Federation would like to thank all partners and donors for their generous response to this appeal. The operation received multilateral contributions from the American Red Cross, the Australian government/Australian Red Cross, the Barbados Red Cross Society, the British government/British Red Cross, the Canadian government/Canadian Red Cross, the Danish Red Cross, the European Community\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), the Finnish Red Cross, the Irish government, the Italian government, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Monaco Red Cross, the Netherlands Red Cross, the Nicaraguan Red Cross, the Norwegian government/Norwegian Red Cross, the OPEC Fund For International Development, the Spanish government/Spanish Red Cross, the Swedish government/Swedish Red Cross, the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent, the Western Union Foundation and private donors. The Cuban Red Cross response was also bilaterally supported by the Finnish Red Cross and the Spanish Red Cross."
