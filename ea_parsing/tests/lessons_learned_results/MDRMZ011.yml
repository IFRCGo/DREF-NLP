  - It is important to maximise indigenous knowledge from the local people in terms
    of water source and location for borehole construction as it has long term effect
    on the population and they have to live with that for years. In addition, water
    management committees were set up and functional in two communities in Mopeia
    is considered a great success of the operation.
