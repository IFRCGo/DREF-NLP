  items:
  - More emphasize on publicity and information management needs to be done in the interest of Iraq case and IRCS as the main humanitarian actor in the country. IRCS needs and requires more pragmatic and funded capacity building programming. Though the capacity building plan is a good and valid one, due to funding shortage only one major training could take place.
  - IRCS needs more capacity building in information management and report writing at programme and HQ department levels. With an enhanced level of report writing ability IRCS would be better placed to go public and demonstrate its action.
  - IRCS will need urgently more disaster management, logistics, and operational capacity building at HQ and Branch levels with emphasize on relief and internal tracking systems including warehouse management and data processing. The priority is on the active IRCS Branch level implementation of capacity building action plan with the HQ DM and logistics unit.
  - Establishing information management unit at the IRCS national headquarters and standardized formats to be used to capture, store and use in a systematic way is a priority.
