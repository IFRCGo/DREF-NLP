  - 'At the community level:'
  - "\u2022 Participatory damage and needs assessments that were carried out in coordination with the local community leaders were a highly effective way to obtain an accurate list of affected people and their needs in a disaster."
  - "\u2022 The community actions such as practical activities and trainings have been an effective methodology to promote the active involvement of women and youth in the communities in both activities and the decision-making process. These practical activities in the context of the operation refer to the construction of water wells, the cultivation of family gardens and training preparation."
  - "\u2022 The communities expressed their satisfaction with the transfer of knowledge and skills which helped them to increase their sources of food intake and income which has reduced their vulnerability and increased their resilience."
  - "\u2022 Community organization and preparedness for disasters is a fundamental activity that facilitates an efficient and effective intervention when an emergency or disaster strikes."
  - 'At the level of volunteering:'
  - "\u2022 The community education in disaster preparedness component of this operation has given an opportunity for the Mexican Red Cross to recruit new volunteers from diverse backgrounds. This is imperative, especially as the National Society is usually thought of as principally as a provider of \u201Cambulance services\u201D; therefore this expands the image of the Red Cross, demonstrating its capacity in other diverse areas of work."
  - "\u2022 The VCA methodology and the \u201CBetter Be Ready\u201D series gave insight into new volunteer actions and interventions at the community level, according high priority to preventive actions and to community mobilization for disaster preparedness and response."
  - 'At the institutional level of the Mexican Red Cross:'
  - "\u2022 The VCA will continue to be used as a tool in each of the plans of action, especially to identify recovery actions in the event of disasters."
  - "\u2022 The National Disaster Response Plan of the Mexican Red Cross should be revised and updated, incorporating preparedness and recovery actions."
  - "\u2022 The work on community mobilization and preparedness has helped the Mexican Red Cross to be more visible and acknowledged by communities."
  - "\u2022 Actions at the community level also offer the MRC opportunities to collaborate with new potential donors in the country, and with international organizations as well as with PNSs."
  - In addition, this operation has started an increased dialogue within the National Society in their work with communities, increasing their focus to include disaster risk reduction and not only disaster response.
  - "The Mexican Red Cross and the International Federation\u2019s Regional Representation for Central America and Mexico conducted a case study after the close of the operation through the regional plan. This document is currently under revision and will be available on the regional website shortly."
